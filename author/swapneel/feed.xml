&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This comes first because people often tend to ignore this very relevant section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; no single way to achieve a successful outcome for your application to graduate school and this post comprises mainly of opinions that I hold based on no evidence other than a product of my personal experience with the process (which is limited, to say the least). All I’m trying to do by writing about this is to give you some perspective to enable you to think for yourself before you embark on the arduous process of applying to grad school. Goodluck!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, please refrain from plagiarising the content. You know how badly a few lifted (and/or uncited) lines could mess up your application (and academic career), right?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at this set of personal statements, instead, as the quality of essays that your competition writes (these are for a mix of Ph.D. and Masters programs) and use it as positive reinforcement to ‘up your game,’ so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While applying to grad school, please don’t make amateur-ish mistakes for your essays. It’s a really cliched piece of advice when people say “you should tell them a story.” Don’t get me wrong, you can. But you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this if you haven’t done so already: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2015/10/how-to-write-a-bad-statement-for-a-computer-science-phd-admissions-application.html&quot;&gt;How to Write a Bad Statement for a Computer Science Ph.D. Admissions Application, Andy Pavlo (CMU)&lt;/a&gt; (it is Ph.D. specific, but you can extrapolate to Masters applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, admissions are very variable and top schools almost always look favourably upon relevant national and international awards, and publications at top-tier venues especially when they filter applicants for competitive programs like CS (AI/ML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaving stories, as stated before, may make or break your case depending on who reviews it. Ultimately I believe it’s a math.random() process because there is a human on the other end, and human intelligence - unlike many manifestations of artificial intelligence - is highly unpredictable. I wanted to share some links for reading before you guys start writing (since we’re only a month out from the earliest deadlines in November, hopefully you’ve already started writing a draft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Statements from professors/research scientists/Ph.D. Students often yield insight into not only their goals, but also areas of active research in general which is why I’m including some samples for candidates to read in order to ‘get a better idea of their field’ before writing their Statement of Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/CV/Research%20Statement.pdf&quot;&gt;Csaba Szepesvári’s Research Statement (University of Alberta, DeepMind)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;my-personal-favourite---anant-bhardwaj-beng-pune-univ-ms-stanford-phd-mit&quot;&gt;My personal favourite - Anant Bhardwaj (B.Eng. Pune Univ., M.S. Stanford, Ph.D. M.I.T.):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mainly because this was the first (and only) Statement of Purpose I read before applying for a Masters in Computer Science right after undergrad (although I later decided not to jump into it, but work at CERN for a year instead).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you read this set of statements, I’d like to explain my reasons for highlighting this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It clearly depicts how an SoP evolves from a story woven around nascent experience working in tech and aimed at a short-term goal into a research statement that focuses on a specific field and hopes to achieve a long-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an Indian B.Eng. student at Mumbai University, I could really identify with this as it was written by a fellow B.Eng. graduate from Pune University.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a good example of progress and change of plans coming from a student who went on to do a Masters at Stanford and a Ph.D. at MIT and then dropped out midway to found a company called Instabase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another disclaimer: please do not treat this as a single representative example of how to frame your statement of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-two-cents-on-this-subject&quot;&gt;My Two Cents on this subject:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these people and a lot of the advice you will see states that they know the exact field they wanted to work on. That is false. Nobody knows exactly what they want to to for the rest of their lives. Very few actually know the general area they want to work on. Most people have only a fair idea and as Ph.D. programs often state on their websites, that is OK. Most of your ideas will change with experience anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you like X a lot but you’ve never tried doing Y, how do you know you don’t like Y and how can you say you won’t like Y more than X once you try it out. That’s understandable. However, you will see that all of these people have one thing in common - clarity. They possess a high degree of clarity in their research focus and know that there are one or two fields that they would definitely like to pursue. All they have done is explain why this is the case. And their innate clarity made the rest of the work they did fit into the theme of their ‘stories.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what you’re trying to do in your essay is explain one or two directions that you would like to take, back your claim up with evidence (yes, material evidence - including grades, research, and/or projects) of why you would do well in those directions, and finally state what you see yourself doing once you actually get into that direction. Clarity of thoughts is way more important and the only reliable way to get that is to actually be aware of what that direction is; follow active research areas and people working in that direction, and finally, at least have some ideas of what you would do if you were given an opportunity to work there. Write confidently; you don’t necessarily need to highlight why you failed or justify any misses if you can focus on the hits. It’s not necessary that your statement of purpose would have to ‘make up for why you’re not as good as you could have been’ as opposed to ‘focus on how good you can be based on what you have already done.’&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/machine-learning-summer-schools">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is the first in a series of posts highlighting my attempt(s) to prepare myself to undertake research and for graduate school. It will include a year in review, learnings from working at CERN, and some technical posts about the kind of work I do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a recent graduate of Computer Engineering working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). I got into a “US top-15” school for pursuing a Masters in Computer Science starting 2018 but chose to work as a Technical Student for a year instead. My goal in spending this year at CERN is to to gain more perspective and better understand my interests before diving straight into graduate school. As I worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DL4Jets/DeepJetCore&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; at the CMS Experiment, I really developed a strong liking for problems we face in high-energy physics. This series of posts will serve as a reflection of the people I have met and experiences I have shared over the past summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-to-summer-schools&quot;&gt;Applying to Summer Schools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year started on a mixed note;  I was excited about working at CERN, but also wondering what directions to take in order to prepare for graduate studies. My aim is to learn by doing and make the most of opportunities that come along. So I decided to figure out how to improve my knowledge of machine learning that was essentially self-taught—taking online courses and working on a project aiding the deployment Tensorflow models in production on the CMS Software Environment. I spent two weeks researching and applying to machine learning summer schools with my supervisor (and former supervisor) supporting me with reference letters wherever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schools had some really cool speakers lined up which I thought would make for a great introduction to subjects like gaussian processes, natural language processing, causal inference, probabilistic methods, bayesian non-parametrics, and optimisation. The application process for the schools was fairly straightforward (often doing away with the reference letter) and encouraged students to present posters of their ongoing/completed projects. I ended up visiting two schools - Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School (Oxford, UK) and Machine Learning Summer School (Madrid, Spain), apart from the Deep Learning Indaba (Stellenbosch, SA). My poster on our work (DeepJet) was presented at MLSS and the Indaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I learnt later how presenting posters forms a critical part of the experience; it fosters discussions on a plethora of interconnected domains promoting quick and reliable knowledge transfer. As Jeff Dean said in a talk at the Deep Learning Indaba, “If I had a choice between reading one research paper in great depth or just skimming through ten papers, I would choose the latter because that gives me a broader idea of the problem space that I can then build upon.” Poster presentations accomplish pretty much the same goal and in addition foster collaboration and interest in relevant work by others you may not otherwise hear of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I also learnt later how lucky I was to have qualified for these events that are otherwise primarily targeted at an audience of Ph.D. students (except for the Deep Learning Indaba). This gave me an invaluable set of opportunities to connect with researchers and graduate students who were perfectly equipped to offer &lt;strong&gt;relevant&lt;/strong&gt; advice to me (a lot of people can offer advice, but very little is often relevant).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief outline of each of these events along with what I learnt from each of them. In this post, I’ve focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/687473&quot;&gt;Fourth Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mlhep-2018&quot;&gt;MLHEP 2018:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School was organised by researchers from Yandex, Skoltech, and HSE at Oxford University in the UK. It is an event targeted at Ph.D. students and Professors in Physics seeking a foothold in machine learning to find applications to their respective problem statements. However, given that I was working on a project along similar lines, it served as a pretty good primer for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;school-highlights&quot;&gt;School Highlights&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The school began with two tracks—one slightly more advanced introduction and another for beginners to programming and data science.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lectures adhered to a (really useful) hands-on format where each talk was followed by a practical coding session teaching the practical uses of each model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018&quot;&gt;MLHEP Starter code&lt;/a&gt; was really well documented and overall quite thorough in its treatment of the subject. It should serve as a useful reference even for those who have not attended the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was a set of invited lectures (one per day) that was truly the highlight of each day. It made me wonder how they shortlisted speakers but whatever the process was, it clearly worked. From an introduction to Quantum Physics and Deep Learning to NVidia’s use of AI, to Advertisements on Oracle Data Cloud, and a detailed architectural breakdown of Google’s newly introduced Tensor Processing Unit - these lectures did not disappoint! The slides for each of these lectures has been kindly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018&quot;&gt;made available&lt;/a&gt; by the organisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Codalab Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amidst a packed (read 7:30 am - 7 pm) schedule that prevented me from visiting this popular vegan joint (sadly, it shut by 5 pm daily) we had yet another activity - a multi-phase &lt;a href=&quot;https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19818&quot;&gt;Codalab Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on the Semantic Segmentation of LArTPC tracks! Phase 1 was now open to us and the rest would follow soon after.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t understand much about the title, don’t be disappointed. I didn’t know much about it either. But I did know that we had free GPU Credit and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018-starterkit&quot;&gt;starter code&lt;/a&gt;, and when someone is so kind as to give you a free GPU and some machine learning models, it is only natural for your overfitting instincts to kick into overdrive. So overfitting aside, that’s exactly what I did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My first four attempts gave me exactly zero accuracy. I had no idea what I was doing wrong. After 14 hours of training (I woke up intermittently through the night to check up on the model) I realized I was not preprocessing the data correctly. Long story short, after a series of modifications to my code, I arrived upon a seriously crappy model and placed almost last on the leaderboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was probably my breaking point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now there were two undergrads at the school who didn’t really participate in the challenge (to my knowledge, and based on the leaderboard). The rest of the thirty-ish people were Physics Ph.D. Students. They understood exactly what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber&quot;&gt;Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber&lt;/a&gt; was in addition to having the same starter code and with a reasonably good understanding of machine learning as well. Then there was me - the third undergrad with almost entirely self-taught knowledge of machine learning (I’ll write another post sometime about my opinion on the Indian Education System) and barely any understanding of the properties of the track data. Did I really expect myself to miraculously arrive at optimal hyperparameters for this problem given that I was already drained after 12 hours of attending the school daily?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then, I binged on a box of Pringles and reevaluated matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was an undergrad among 2nd and 3rd year Ph.D. students (also some Professors) and I still managed to not only get in but also successfully understand most of the topics taught in the school.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The very fact that I had a submission placed me in the top-30% of the school (many people decided against participating due to various issues including the time constraints and a limited understanding of the starter code).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did finally start understanding what LArTPC was about, after watching some introductory lectures. It wasn’t that complicated. And the history of the problem was very cool (I like reading about the story behind things).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used the more complicated model - the Message-passing Neural Network instead of the Convolutional Neural Network simply because I wanted to ‘try something new.’ I managed my model fairly well by tweaking the learning rate, playing around with dropout to prevent overfitting, switching around optimizers, and adjusting the number of training epochs. The accuracy (to my recollection) was 80-something percent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given that it was my first Kaggle-like challenge, this was a pretty great outcome. Giving up now would be a very silly idea. Either way, there was only a day more left. Instead, why not try to push harder for a day without any expectation and see what I get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I landed up 4th on the Phase 1 Leaderboard for the challenge with an accuracy of 90-something percent. This wasn’t the miracle win I expected (blame Hollywood for setting my expectations high) but it was undoubtedly a decent result for a first-timer given the aforementioned constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next morning, the CodaLab Challenge winners were asked to present their models. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018/blob/master/day6-Sun/AlexHeld-20180812_MLHEP2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, who stood first on the leaderboard, came up to explain his entry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As I listened to Alex talk about how he visualized the data (used the CNN for visualizing the features? not clear on this) and tweaked the learning rate and a lot of jargon (but in the nice sense), I was very impressed with the work. Having nothing else to focus on as they announced the next winner, I started planning my journey back to Heathrow from Oxford - I didn’t want to miss my flight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A friend sitting next to me elbows me as he points to the leaderboard. “Isn’t that you?” 
“What?”
“&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smehta&lt;/code&gt;, that’s your username right?”
“Oh, right. Well, shit.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mother of God, I stood second. How? Well, you see the challenge had multiple phases, and they simply used the test data from the second phase (only slightly advanced from Phase 1) to evaluate the models. This resulted in some models not performing as well - surprisingly enough, mine did. They had told us this before, and I remember I had tweaked my training and preprocessing to accommodate for a better score overall, but I was so busy with training afterwards that I forgot they would consider the results of Phase 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can the user &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smehta&lt;/code&gt; please come up and explain their approach?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I knew I wasn’t going to follow up Alex’s presentation with something really technical so I decided to do the easy thing - tell them exactly how I did it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve never used a Message-passing Neural Network and I wanted to see how it works so that was my main motivation in participating in this challenge. My first few tries failed which was when I updated my preprocessing pipeline. The core principle I used to tweak my training parameters was basically what Andrew Ng said in Coursera Machine Learning, Week 4 - ‘If you are approaching a minima you need to adjust your number of training steps and learning rate such that you neither overshoot it nor converge too slow.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call machine learning (sarcasm? maybe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for more posts about experiences from the two other events that I had the privilege to attend this year - Machine Learning Summer School (Madrid), and the Deep Learning Indaba (South Africa).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/a-students-guide-to-living-abroad">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is part of a series of posts. While this one is focused on making preparations for the travel, the next one will (hopefully) provide deeper insight into how life works and what to expect from the outside world based on my experience so far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I told my mom that I’d be traveling to live in a new country: in this case, France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You will die of starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She seemed supportive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks were spent teaching me to avoid dying of starvation and it would seem mom made it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been through the process, I’ve got some tips and tricks to share for students going about this the first time around. I’ve tried to use broad strokes and avoid region-specific concerns but you can feel free to email me about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is meant to serve as a guideline for traveling like a beast — obtaining maximal efficiency with minimal luggage; learning the ropes of survival on 35kg of baggage allowance. It incorporates elements of preparedness for moving to a new house, living alone in a new city, with new people around. I’ll try to use examples of my own practices although, fair warning, I’m no expert and still need to sit on my bags to shut them. But at least I don’t have to haggle with the check-in crew for extra kilos anymore (I lied, I still do).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Indian boy, especially a Gujarati (we’re known for our affinity with food), traveling abroad I honestly had one single concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How much of my kitchen can I possibly stuff into my luggage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, it’s a trade-off between carrying that prized cardigan or a pack of freeze-dried paranthas (Indian flat-breads). In my case, I had about 35 kilos of luggage allowance, but evidently even two bags of 23kg are not enough for some whilst migrating to a new land. A lot of my rather affluent friends purchase additional luggage to transport a sizeable chunk of India along with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is basically me trying to tell you (and parents possibly concerned about your survival), “Chill out. You’ll live.”
(Not) Planning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I traveled to Switzerland for a couple of months, I didn’t bother to plan. That’s a really bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I carried along a lot of stuff that I could actually have bought for cheaper in France/Switzerland compared to India. This included a truckload of clothes, some food items, and spices that I never ended up using. Let’s take a look at these items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready-to-drink Tea Mix: Unless you’re traveling extensively, you’re not going to need more than 5–7 single sachets of this mix. Usually, I prefer the normal way of boiling tea leaves with milk and that’s been replaced slowly by the fantastic coffee I get out here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freeze-dried Food: My mother, after substantial research, painstakingly cooked 7 kilos of two different vegetable curries (Pav Bhaji and Mixed Veg.) and had them dehydrated into packs of food that I could then simply boil and eat. To be fair, it was a pretty useful item until I realized that I could actually cook. Then it became a really mundane meal and I kinda liked the fresh, hot, spicy (even shitty) food that I made, so quite a few packs were left unused by the end of my stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chilly Flakes and Oregano: These two Italian spices are used globally, so carrying huge packets, in my opinion, was not a great use of my limited luggage space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biscuits: Don’t waste your time and space trying to stuff five packs of Bourbon down your bag when we all know the first thing you’re going to do is buy Oreo in wholesale quantities once you land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rice and Flour: A friend of mine wanted to carry along kilos of rice and flour. People eat both these items the world over, so please calm down and search for the nearest grocer. I can guarantee with absolute certainty you will be able to find affordably priced products nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thermal Wear: Google the weather before traveling, and for heaven’s sake don’t go overboard with your woolens. If it’s a cold place, it’s very likely the stores nearby will stock cheap winter wear. Some of them have really great deals in the summer so buying in advance might save you dem moneys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socks: Amazon is everywhere. Amazon delivers the heavens to your doorstep. I carried along like twelve pairs of socks but I could just as well have bought them in France (or via Amazon France). Sure, they may be a little more expensive, but you could use the extra space to carry along spices that you might need more than the socks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toiletries: Travel packs are fine, but there’s really little use in carrying along bigger bottles of shaving gel, shampoos, soaps, etc. especially if it’s not medically necessitated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes: Carrying your wardrobe along is a painstaking process, not to mention an expensive one in terms of baggage allowance. If you’re going someplace in the summer just take a look at the local shops, sales, and order online. In my case, the $100 I would spend on carrying an extra bag of clothes could be used to buy the same number/quality of clothes from local shops (H&amp;amp;M, Celio, etc.) in the summer sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how that works, let’s move onto the actual planning that would help optimize your packing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packing is all about prioritizing what you need. Some things are vital, others just aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: Food is ubiquitous. People eat food everywhere. Don’t look so surprised, it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I had no clue what kind of food I’d rely on in Switzerland, so I did what anyone with half a brain (and little use for it) would do: I brought my kitchen with me. Every single spice I could lay my hands on, I stuffed into the bag. However, when I actually spent 15 minutes searching for alternatives once I arrived in Switzerland, I was able to find a decent set of brick-and-mortar Indian stores in pretty much every major city from San Francisco to Delft, and Boston to Geneva. Apart from that there’s online options available in the USA as well as Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did eventually end up ordering online via a store called Swiss Rasoi that gave us a decent discount since we found 4 other Indians and ordered products in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: They have a sale each month, email them about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course the trade-off for buying this stuff abroad is that you pay a lot more than you would in India. But if you’re moving abroad for a longer duration, you’re going to have to bite the bullet at some point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-tips&quot;&gt;Planning Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy City:&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is at your fingertips. Don’t just search for places, search for people already there. Ask for suggestions unabashedly. Figure out the hacks that can help you live an easier life; I don’t just mean free refills of soda at the local fast food joints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Weather:&lt;/strong&gt; Having knowledge of the kind of weather you are going into is very helpful because it can help you plan the kind of clothing you require. If you’re traveling in the summer, you can purchase winter clothes on sale, saving yourself copious amounts of both, cash and luggage allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Locality:&lt;/strong&gt; Even within cities, it is often a diverse landscape and some neighborhoods may be better than others (also more expensive). If you’re traveling, try to use Google Street View to check out the locality, the local stores, and most importantly whether Amazon delivers to the ZIP code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Public Transport System:&lt;/strong&gt; A systematic public transport system is extremely crucial in saving your time and can help you figure out the feasibility of traveling to local stores. Most of the times, you will find that Google Maps offers a fairly accurate picture of the schedules and means of transport but this is not always the case. Try to figure out the apps that help track local bus, tram and train schedules and check your connectivity to assess how likely it is that you can shop for groceries daily/weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Roommates:&lt;/strong&gt; I got lucky to find the best roommates ever. We cooked, cleaned, worked, and traveled together. Connecting with your roomies beforehand enables you to split essentials, manage your packing e.g. not everyone needs to carry that mini-pressure cooker or the same old bunch of spices. Besides, it helps to know you’re not living with serial killers. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Telecom Providers:&lt;/strong&gt; International packs from India cost me between INR 2,500 and INR 4,000 and gives me maybe a hundred minutes of calling to India, a couple of gigs of internet and so on. A Freemobile (yes, it’s a company) costs me 25 Euro (~INR 1,600) and gives me 50–100GB of pan-Europe internet, and unlimited calling to international* numbers (including India). It’s always simpler if you know the plans in the country you’re moving to because eventually you’re going to be getting them anyway.
*maximum of 200 different phone numbers, but it’s still a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-visa-application&quot;&gt;The Visa Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I required a Schengen Visa for my work in Europe, but before that I was planning on attending school in the USA so I had an active F1-Visa that I later returned following the return of my I-20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Schengen Visa permits travel within 26 countries situated in EU and Switzerland (Switzerland is not officially a part of the EU but for practical purposes, you don’t need to worry about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This also means the Swiss use the Swiss Franc (CHF) and not the Euro. Some places accept both, but offer bad exchange rates for Euro to CHF conversion so you’re better off carrying CHF in advance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-swiss-schengen-visa&quot;&gt;The Swiss (Schengen) Visa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Visa Application in India, VFS is a courier company that collects your application and biometric details and sends it off to the Swiss Embassy in New Delhi. Some tips for the application for the Swiss Visa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be clear about your Visa-type. For students, it’s usually the &amp;lt;90-day Visa or for longer stays (e.g. 1 year), the Type D National Visa (at least at CERN).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the Visa-type there are checklists available for the supporting documents required. Go through these thoroughly before doing anything else. Read a few different checklists if you’re like me and want to get a better idea of what you might need (even though you really won’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preferably book an appointment 6+ weeks before your travel dates. It barely takes a few days for your Visa to arrive but having a buffer period is safer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, you need to get a bank statement verified by an official that shows you have some funds to sustain your lifestyle. For most banks this takes a few days so get it done early on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get your bookings in order; especially residence. You can use Booking.com or Hotels.com for at least a temporary accommodation solution until you finalize the details of your stay. I booked my return-trip flights in advance but I’ve been told it’s not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a very “stringent” procedure because it’s not “an interview” — as per my understanding, VFS acts as an intermediary, and is supposed to help you out with preparing your application for the Schengen Visa. So no need to be nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Visa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my F1 Visa Application, I have a vague recollection of the procedure so I’ll be brief; please confirm these details before proceeding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It had (understandably) a far more detailed application form than the Schengen Visa. They asked me about all the times I had visited the USA in the past and I had to dig up my expired passports to look up the exact dates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They require an I-20 if you’re applying for the F1 or (if I’m not mistaken) J1 Visa. The I-20 must also be presented at the time of arrival in the USA (at immigration).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the fees are to be paid online and cost me somewhere around $160 (INR 10,000) at the time of application.
There are two separate appointments: one for collecting your biometric details and another for the actual “interview.” Yes, this is an actual interview and if you do not answer to their satisfaction, they reserve the right to refuse your Visa without justification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As per what I have seen and heard, your finances matter here. I can’t offer any “magic combination” to pass all scrutiny but simply be clear about what you are saying and avoid falsifying information at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a hunch that your institute matters because I was going only for a summer but I was given a 5-year F1 Visa. My I-20 was from a highly reputed institute so maybe that made life much easier for me. Or maybe I just got lucky (although I ended up returning the I-20 and Visa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flight-selection&quot;&gt;Flight Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booking flights isn’t always about getting the cheapest travel option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it mostly is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student, it is easy to just go for the cheapest options but if you’re looking to go a little deeper think about it this way: if you travel smart, the more you travel, the cheaper it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So a slightly more expensive flight option now will get you not only more comfort and luggage allowance now but also help you improve your traveler status and increase the probability of free upgrades in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will avoid going into details but you can read more about airline alliances that comprise of 3 major groups of airlines that allow you to earn miles when you fly any of them in the same group. Later you can redeem them for vouchers, discounts, and of course free flights. Alliances also have tie-ups with some credit card companies and car rental services to help you earn free miles so take a closer look and maybe you’ll find yourself traveling business class on a free upgrade before the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is to request student status, a provision most carriers offer. At the very least you get extra luggage allowance, but sometimes you might get good discounts. Student tickets are often non-refundable so ensure that you’ve got a solid plan in place before finalizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: If you travel like I do (overfilled luggage; prepared to haggle at check-in counters), it helps to transfer most of your weight to the ‘laptop bags’ or ‘purses.’ They have never bothered to ask me about the big-ass laptop bag I carried with me (I travel Emirates, in case you’re wondering).
Update: Based on a friend’s experience, Etihad did charge them for extra kilos at Abu Dhabi. Avoid pushing your luck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;layovers&quot;&gt;Layovers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be very excited about flights (note the past tense). The first time I booked my trip from India, I picked a Lufthansa flight to Geneva with a 9-hour layover in Munich because why the heck not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a plan, and a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take the Lufthansa shuttle into Munich and then figure out where I can travel around. I never looked into the places I could visit — I would have data or at least free WiFi and I could figure it out.
The Backup Plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munich airport is rated 2nd in the World. It has a mini-golf course and a spa, among other amenities. It costs about 6CHF which is decent. Worst case, I play 9 hours of mini-golf. Not a bad way to spend the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality&quot;&gt;Reality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data pack was inactive. No network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No problem, I have free WiFi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WiFi isn’t connecting and there’s nobody around that speaks English to help. In fact, there’s literally nobody around except a few security guys and cleaning staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s alright lets skip the city shuttle and enjoy the mini-golf and spa.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s a Saturday morning. The activities are in another terminal and that’s shut for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Fuuu…..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eventually I managed to figure out the location of the shuttle stop at the airport and reach the city center. A kind stranger bought me a train ticket and I roamed around some park; I still don’t remember the name. I ate at an Indian restaurant handled by jovial Pakistani dudes (it’s way more common than you’d think). Turns out the city is pretty lively towards the afternoon and I was served some crappy Lebanese brunch (“Sir, your vegan food”) whilst strolling around the farmer’s market before heading back to the airport. Pretty great layover overall, but things could have gone very wrong that day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planning-done-right&quot;&gt;Planning Done Right&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I traveled to Geneva, I was a seasoned veteran of air-travel (mostly just in my head though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still ended up over-packing, rearranged my baggage at check-in, haggled with the personnel, and successfully managed to carry the other half of India into Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, I was more aware of what I should carry along and the items that had most helped the past summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cash: It isn’t really necessary in the USA since most stores accept card payment, but in some places around France we still are required to pay in cash so it becomes necessary to carry sufficient cash or find an ATM assuming you have low fees for international withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Universal Travel Adapters: Mostly due to my Macbook (USB-C ftw), but also travel adapters are mighty useful to have in general. They can get pretty expensive to buy on airports or souvenir shops so be sure to carry a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essential Spices (bare minimum):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Chaipatti (Dried, Crushed Tea Leaves);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Red Chilly Powder;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dhanajiru (Cumin + Coriander Powder);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turmeric;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Jeera (Cumin);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rai (Mustard Seeds);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hing (Asafoetida);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Chaat Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Garam Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: you get sugar, pepper, and salt literally everywhere, including the airplane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced Cooking (bare minimum):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Poha (Rice Flakes);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Biryani Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pav Bhaji Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Aamchur (Dry Mango Powder);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gud (Jaggery);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Imli (Tamarind);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tejpatta (Bayleaf);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Elaichi (Cardamom);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Laung (Cloves);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dalchini (Cinnamon);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kali Mirch (Black Pepper).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Namkeen: You don’t always have time to shop so keep some ready-to-eat food handy just in case you need it:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Maggi, always;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Haldiram’s Poha.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready-made Food Mix: Basically these are powders that you can use for various purposes without much effort:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MTR Dosa Mix;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MTR Upma Mix;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talod Dhokla Mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vacuum-sealed Stuff: The first time I went, mother made some rotis, theplas, and paranthas (different Indian breads) at home and had them vacuum-sealed at the local grocer. It lasted around 2 months since I put it in the freezer immediately once I reached France. It’s a temporary hack, but it works. She also made me a minced chilly mix that I didn’t use as much but was helpful when we ran out of green chillies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooking Appliances: The Pressure Cooker is infinitely useful. It is indispensable unless you have enough time to spend in the kitchen boiling rice and potatoes in a pan (this doesn’t take as long as you’d imagine). Get a small one along, it is worth the effort. I tried to carry a Roti Maker this time but unfortunately when I tried it out, the voltage shorted it. Sucks. But I can make roti without a roti-maker (that’s a lie, I’m too lazy). Okay fine, I will try again and update this post. Next, there’s the Pav Bhaji masher — I’m unaware of its exact name but hopefully you get what I mean. Finally, carry a good thermos along for the daily beverage or simply hot water, if you can spare the luggage space for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old Passports: If you intend on traveling to multiple countries, some places ask about your travel history for the Visa Application. It isn’t mandatory, but it helps if you have your older (even expired) passports to carry along.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving License: One big plus is that if you can drive in India, you can drive pretty much anywhere (in theory). Your license is valid between 6 months to 1 year, but it is advisable to get an international license made because it’s much cheaper in India. It’s amazing how empty the roads are, but ensure you know the road rules. Parking spots are a pain to find and more importantly understand. Fines are hefty. Also, don’t drink and drive. You can’t afford it. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photocopies of Documents: At the office, I can take free printouts. But outside, photocopies aren’t priced at a rupee for a side. Carry attested/sealed copies of at least your mark-sheets, passport, and Visa in case it is required on short-notice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passport-sized Photographs: Carry about thirty. I’m not kidding; Schengen requires a different format from the standard passport-sized photographs. Get the standard as well as Schengen-format photos printed so that you save time and effort spent on getting them made abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Munchies are awesome. Food here is bland, and most of my junk food comprises chips. “Mobile” Khakhra (Roasted flatbread) is a welcome break when I’m too lazy to get snacks at the cafeteria. Mother dearest found me packs of kurmura (puffed rice flakes) I wish I’d carried Soya Sticks but I believe it should be available at the local Asian store. 
&lt;strong&gt;Update: it was not :(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy Bars: They’re available in a range of varieties at almost all grocerie sand they’re extremely easy to carry around. I have 2 in my bag at all times. Usually I prefer to buy them from abroad instead of carrying them from home. But it works either way. Nature Valley is decently priced if you buy the larger packs off Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parachute Coconut oil (small bottle): Easiest remedy for dry hair after days of daily shampooing. Honestly. Silky Smooth Amazeness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toiletries: While most of these are unnecessary in large quantities, you would do well to carry the tongue cleaner. It’s pretty useful if you don’t find a toothbrush that fits the bill. Seriously. Also nail-cutters; tiny, but very useful once every two weeks (that’s what she said). As a cleanliness freak, I carry a hand sanitizer wherever I go. I just have to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backpack: Invest in a sturdy, light-weight backpack that can be useful on both a regular basis as well as weekend trips. Nobody likes lugging suitcases around. You could figure out decent options once you arrive in case you’re aware of good sales. I know for a fact France has great offers during the summers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronics: If you don’t like spending a lot on electronics, carry a decent set of headphones, extra USB cables, and universal adapters. I like to exercise so bluetooth headphones are a necessity. For backups and other data storage. It could actually be cheaper to purchase hard drives in flash sales (or holiday sales) abroad, but we all know the sources of the ‘data’ that you need are of questionable legality outside the country so you’re going to bring one along anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shoes: If you’re going to indulge in adventure activities please bear in mind that healthcare costs skyrocket pretty easily. If you’re covered by insurance, that’s fine. But since I started play squash, football, and running, I’ve spent a bit of money on good quality running shoes that enable me to run on concrete without the jarring impact to my knees. I’m still dicey on skiing though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack of Cards: Monopoly Deal, Uno, plain old playing cards; try to stuff in whatever you can once you’re done packing the important stuff. Extremely useful when you decide to travel around with your friends and have nothing to do once you’ve uploaded 1500 snap-stories from the car/train/hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that covers pretty much all of the basic items you’d require to survive comfortably in a new environment. I’ll update the post with relevant information over time. But for now, good luck preparing for your travels!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2017-04-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>/cern-openlab-internship</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/cern-openlab-internship">&lt;p&gt;This post is about my internship within the CERN Openlab Program in 2017 and includes a questionnaire (hopefully) useful for students applying to the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The views represented here are solely my own, and do not reflect those of my employer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past summer, I worked as an intern at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is an international research collboration working on high-energy physics and computing, set in a picturesque location cradling the borders of France and Switzerland. I have been receiving a lot of messages about the application process and this post is an attempt to try and address some queries regarding the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had filled out a highly detailed application form last October, wondering if I had a snowball’s chance in hell to get selected into one of the most prestigious programs at possibly the most unique research collaboration on the face of the earth. After a few months of sleepless nights and particle-filled daydreams, I received the much-awaited email from CERN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was a rejection email from the Summer Student program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a disappointing week as I tried to move on and apply for other internships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was soon a ray of light shining through this darkness, in the form of an offer to undertake research at Stanford University and I jumped at the marvelous opportunity. As I finally completed my US Visa Application and acceptance of the Stanford offer, I received yet another email from CERN. This time, it wasn’t a ding. I got into the CERN Openlab Program! The rest as they say, is history. I spoke with my potential advisor at CERN and the Professors at Stanford who were extremely supportive of my decision to accept the offer from CERN. A month later, I was sitting on the Y Bus traveling from Geneva Airport to my hotel in Saint-Genis Pouilly, France.
The City of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internship at CERN has been an amazing learning experience not just in terms of the work but also in terms of people — each with a unique story to tell. These factors have contributed in no small part to the life-changing experience this has been. I arrived as a wide-eyed teenager, and left as a wider-eyed teenager, with an insatiable curiosity to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CERN drives you to push a little harder, seek a deeper understanding, and try to find a better solution to the problems you work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work was understanding, modeling, and ultimately solving a problem — also about addressing the complexities that arose when we attempted to expand the solution to a broader set of applications. With an organisation of this scale, there are going to be multiple problems of a similar nature, with fine lines of separation. As my supervisor told me, it’s a personal decision whether you’d want to focus on a microscopic solution that can address a niche problem which may impact macroscopic issues intrinsically, or to attempt to create an an inherently macroscopic solution that could potentially be tweaked to address challenges affecting narrower segments of work in greater depth. CERN afforded me the opportunity to choose my path in spite of being just one of many hundreds of summer students. Amazingly enough, I learnt over the course of the summer, this was a privilege extended to all members of CERN regardless of position or responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit for a fantastic summer belongs, in no small part, with my supervisors, both of whom were the driving forces constantly challenging me to research and review better practices and improve the models for my project — Anomaly Detection in Database Connections. Mr. Prasanth Kothuri and Mr. Daniel Lanza Garcia helped me figure out the research subjects that aligned with my interests and constantly supporting me in terms of resources and domain expertise. If Mr. Kothuri was doubtful about the solution to my issues that were seemingly esoteric, he would encourage me to find others at CERN who possessed the domain-specific knowledge and even accompanied me to some seminars in order to seek the same understanding as I would — and eventually figure out a solution together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was really encouraging to find this kind of support being extended and responsibilities being shared with us in one of the most active and experienced groups at CERN compared to the common treatment as ‘just an intern.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/cern-openlab.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;CERN Globe of Science and Innovation&quot; /&gt;
The Globe of Science and Innovation —emblematic of the values CERN embodies (Jessica Wallis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I was working on involved detecting anomalous database connections in order to serve multiple purposes including but not limited to analysing and deriving insights from usage patterns, monitoring the number of connections, and ultimately database security. With no real benchmarks or training data in this field, we set out to find a solution and use various machine learning practices and models to apply unsupervised learning and arrive at a conclusive result. We managed to utilise an ensemble of different models that measured deviation based on differing metrics. Further, we cross-verified results and extracted common anomalies that were then flagged to be verified. Through my interactions with my peers within the same program, I realized a lot of us were working on the same problem with different forms of data. I was motivated to move beyond the scope of my project and build an intuitive system that could not only provide a common base to leverage these models, but also offer an intuitive interface for non-technical users, seeing as a lot of CERN staff include physicists that may not be familiar with cutting-edge computing practices. It was a start towards utilising the research that has gone into multiple Openlab projects into a single end-user application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal front, this experience has taught me a lot about people and the way they look at a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had always been reading about how it helps to have different perspectives towards the same problem and I often wondered what it meant. Meeting students literally from the other side of the globe has taught me that there is a lot of truth to this statement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have probably the best roommates I’ve ever had — notwithstanding the fact that these are the only roommates I’ve ever had. We have cooked, cleaned, driven, trekked, hitchhiked, played, and somersaulted off boats together. Openlab has really provided a unique platform that has resulted in friendships across continents and a network that encompasses most countries across the world. It leads to a sense of security — no matter where we go on after this experience, we will have friends nearby that we can count on in times of need or maybe just to blow off some steam over the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could rave about the past summer until the end of time because it’s hard to out all my experiences into a single blog post but I figure I have to sum it up at some point so I would like to conclude with some quotes from one of the wiser role models in my life, Master Shifu from Kung-Fu Panda, as answers to some of the common questions people have been asking me about getting into CERN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is CERN looking for? What do I write on my application? How did you get into CERN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your real strength comes from being the best you you can be. Who are you? What are you good at? What makes you, you?”
“There is no secret ingredient”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write about yourself, your experiences, your projects, and trust the universe to align the rest of the factors. Maybe you get in, maybe you don’t. All I can say is that you need to ensure you research every detail about CERN before applying because my motivation for applying was derived from the nature of work being undertaken within the specific department that ultimately accepted me. Keep trying until you make it, because honestly, if I did it, you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was your experience at CERN? Is it really worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(in case the blog post wasn’t clear enough)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would do it all over again, twelve times over. Because thirteen is just an unlucky number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the other programs similar? Is it worth undertaking other opportunities at CERN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perspective is rather biased because like I said, I’ve had an amazing summer. I would always want to go back to CERN (and I did get back as a Technical Student for a year following Openlab). However there are periods where I’ve been told there’s very little activity, when the climate isn’t all that great, and there are hardly any people on the streets of Geneva. It’s not ideal, but your work is undoubtedly going to remain challenging and interesting regardless of how it is outside the window. It’s just that life becomes slightly slow. You must learn to adapt at some point, and this is a great place bustling with activities ranging from Zumba and Krav Maga to lunch hours with random people in order to get to know them better. It’s such a diverse environment that you never going to be bored with so many different nationalities around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the format for your resume? Can you share it with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(added this since there have been so many students asking me about this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a no-brainer, there is no single acceptable format for the resume. All they ask for is a document that carries your experience, achievements, and possibly projects in a succinct, neat format. It is really a pretty simple document to create using the infinite wisdom of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have been selected as a reserve candidate. What are my chances of getting selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of selection at CERN (Openlab, Technical Student, and Summer Student), as I probably mentioned already (or maybe not) is that they have unique projects each year, for which they require a diverse skillset. There is no single set of skills for which they have an opening each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each supervisor proposes his/her own set of students — there isn’t really a centralized selection committee to filter through the thousands of candidates that apply (although there is one to oversee final selections). So again, nobody can really tell you what your chances are based on past candidates or projects. Please refrain from spamming people with emails regarding this particular aspect because when most of them say they aren’t aware, they really do mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically for the ‘reserved candidates’ I am unaware of the exact process — all I can tell is that it is not an outright rejection but neither does it imply with certainty that your selection is imminent. That is all I know of at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, I’ve reached the end of the tiny window that I’ve provided into my work and life at CERN. It was an amazing eight weeks and I look forward to seeing more of this place in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I am back at CERN, working as a Technical Student so I’ll probably be updating this article to eliminate any inaccuracies for posterity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post comprises of a list of lectures that I intend to watch at some point in order to mainly just learn more about these domains. They seem like some interesting areas to explore and some are just plain fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;: This list is just for personal reference; you may use it if you like, but it is by no means an exhaustive list.&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;That said, I have put in a fair bit of research into comparing prerequisites and course information across MIT, Stanford and other colleges whilst compiling this list that should provide a fair overview, to an undergraduate student interested in exploring Machine Learning and Computer Vision, of the courses that relate to the applications of these practices in Genetics and Genomics (yes, they're disparate branches of Biology).&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It's just a list of courses that I'm interested in, oriented around ML and CV.&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/the-blog" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Blog" />
      <published>2017-03-21T00:00:00+01:00</published>
      <updated>2017-03-21T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>/the-blog</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/the-blog">&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-blog&quot;&gt;Why Blog?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to look back on the things that I do and writing comes easily to me - it just seems like the logical thing to do. Frankly, I’m surprised it took me so long to actually (finally) build a decent-ish blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a line, it helps get things off my mind in a quick, efficient, indexable manner. Writing often serves as a great tool for introspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to putting this together after a 5-year journey spanning Wordpress, Blogger, Medium, and plain ol’ &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; drafts of posts that are now likely to see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still thinking of a better title for this blog but in the meanwhile I think I’m just going to leave it as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-details&quot;&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with the posts written in Markdown. 
I’ve used a theme called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2&quot;&gt;Jasper2&lt;/a&gt; that’s based on the default theme for a publishing platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it out, it’s pretty neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of advice to the readers - my opinions are thoughtful, but loosely held (I swear this is not motivated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/principles/&quot;&gt;Farnam Street Principles&lt;/a&gt;). When I write opinion pieces, I do not see it as a permanent and unchanging stance for the simple reason that I do not believe I know everything about anything. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
