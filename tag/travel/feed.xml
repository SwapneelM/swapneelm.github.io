      <content type="html" xml:base="/why-i-like-to-travel">&lt;p&gt;Travel is a great teacher. That is, essentially, the summary of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I havenâ€™t traveled a lot by conventional standards - I do not (cannot) claim to represent the broad generality of travel in my views. But I did take a whirlwind tour of summer schools and conferences across London, Madrid, and South Africa across a month that did give me an insight into the world of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craziness is what my mother called it; adventure is my description of these journeys. In the past year, I have scoured the murky depths of price-comparison websites for deals, booked flights on seedy airlines, missed connections, been denied a Visa until hours before the flight, been dropped off to my hotel by kind strangers, and been mugged (without loss of any valuables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view of travel has its nuances based on my expectations of what an ideal trip is, and these expectations are bound to vary with people of different ages, cultures, professions, and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
