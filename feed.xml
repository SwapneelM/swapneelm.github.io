I have formerly worked at CERN Openlab with the IT Dept. and currently work with the Experimental Physics Dept. at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment. This few-thousand word post is a reflection of what I learnt from my supervisor, my team, my collaborators, and the high-energy physics (HEP) community at large. It is peppered with pointers to more resources about HEP for engineers with little background in HEP and lays particular emphasis on particle track reconstruction and graph neural networks, an area I spent a few months working on. Finally, it tells the story of the research, development, summer schools, and exploration that equipped me with a skillset to take into my doctoral degree that begins this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;physics-is-fcking-awesome&quot;&gt;Physics is F*cking Awesome!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world went nuts when the Higgs Boson was discovered at CERN, even though it was essentially just two matching bumps on a histogram. The world was thrilled when astrophysicists revealed the first image of a Black Hole even though that image without context could be mistaken for an out-of-focus circular blot. Science is becoming cool again (tbh it always was, we just forgot about it)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Science was always cool, it was just that responsibility sometimes killed curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I realised physics, and science as a whole, is much more than just a decade’s worth of classes at elementary school and high school - it is an exploration of the world driven by pure fascination, guided by a curiosity to formalize what is known even as we investigate the unknown. For these reasons, I feel a title like this is not too far off from what most people would agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is assuming that I know what I am doing, but some of the smartest people I have had the pleasure of working with are involved in this field so I basically trust they know what they are doing and follow them into machine learning for high-energy physics. C’est la vie, or at least C’est ma vie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Get to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I have explored some bits and pieces of high energy physics so in a high-level overview, let me share what I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics explains the universe as we know it. It explains how we are born, blink, bathe, brush, bite, beget, and breathe unto death. Physics as I understand it is divided broadly into the classical and quantum realms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Classical physics is the stuff most of us learnt in school. Newton’s Laws of Motion, Electricity, Magnetism, Fluid Mechanics; ideas in classical physics work with approximations that we once learned of. For instance, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle tells us we cannot accurately measure both position and mass of an object but in practice we do not bother calculating the micrometer differences in position since they aren’t significant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quantum physics, on the other hand, falls into the realm of atoms and molecules. We learnt about the Periodic Table and Aufbau’s Principle for filling orbitals with electrons but there is so much more to this. A brief Wikipedia search will reveal that contrary to what most elementary school physics taught us, the proton and neutron are not indivisible - in fact there are entire families of smaller charged particles. The study of their interactions and properties is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to miss out on a related area since I already brought up the first black hole image, Astrophysics is another branch that deals with the study of celestial bodies, radiation, space, and all that it holds for mankind to comprehend. The kick-ass visualizations of the ‘5th dimension’ in Interstellar or the idea of the space-time continuum in some form draw from quantum physics but fall broadly under the umbrella of astrophysics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another upcoming area - quantum computing doesn’t immediately strike many people as belonging largely to the domain of quantum physics. It also has its roots in electrical and electronics engineering given the requirement for superconductivity and extremely low temperatures. It has a long way to go but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mentality-and-other-broken-things&quot;&gt;The Mentality, and other Broken Things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Branding is &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; in a country like India, as is the case with most other places. We think quality scales linearly with brand; we forget that expense scales geometrically with it, which would render even a great quality improvement worthless given alternative options. Many customers will shell out unreasonable amounts for sub-par products from recognizable brands than spend half that amount on high-quality, unbranded ones. Now extend this concept to education and you can understand how things get messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter-claim:&lt;/strong&gt; This is not to say that everyone sees things the same way - brand over value at an exorbitant price not being worth it. Further criticism would involve arguments along the lines of ‘job prospects also scale linearly with brand’ and the fact that most recruiters are still biased in favor of brand-name schools. I am guilty of ascribing to brand over value at some points in my career and so are my friends, their parents, teachers, and counselors. It isn’t necessarily a bad thing; but when brand is misplaced and it adds little value - that’s when things spiral down a rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Indians, we have been exposed to this ‘mentality’ right from our childhood - and it doesn’t help when the norms are skewed in favor of this mentality of ‘brand’ being king such that any other source of equivalent value is belittled. What I refer to is the fact that the Indian Institutes of Technology, National Institutes of Technology, and some top private colleges are treated as ‘premier’ institutes that produces an ‘elite’ breed of engineers. This crop of students is purportedly so fantastic that they are offered multiples of the salaries that graduates from other institutes are offered for the same role, at the same level of experience by most companies. The salaries are representative, on most occasions, of the respect and responsibilities accorded to them as employees solely on the basis of the institution name printed on their diplomas. Aside from real issues like false positives (undeserving people being hired), this doesn’t lead to a great culture and often foments discontentment and grudges between employees especially in the event of salary details being disclosed to one another. Companies need to realize that in spite of receiving superior training (let’s not debate this for now) every IITian is not a star. They are great engineers, but not always worth 2x - 3x a regular engineer. In fact, they miss out on a lot of great local talent in favor of hiring from what they see as better institutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand this is a rant. I understand IITians work hard, possibly harder on average than a student from a Tier-II institute. But if you take a look at the sheer number of opportunities made available to them, you will realize how unfair the distribution is in relation to the ratio of students at these premier institutes. I took two years to actually understand this disparity myself and was lucky to find a workaround and get to where I wanted. Most of my peers were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, these kids worked hard to get to the ‘premier’ institutes, so why are you shitting on them for that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this probably makes it seem like I am salty about not being from one of these institutes. Not really. Sure, I had a slightly hard time digesting the fact that I would &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be seen as a student from a Tier-II institute whether it was for job applications, internships, or a Masters degree. But I quickly grew accustomed to it. Also, to be fair, I have seen both sides of this coin. Working at CERN has its perks, you see. Take the example of presenting your work to an audience that does not have a strong background in physics. This happened with me on a few occasions, but I do not feel like I took undue advantage of the CERN ‘brand’ simply because I worked extremely hard on the project (my supervisors could concur) and arguably deserved the positive feedback I received; but I could definitely imagine not working that hard and still receiving the same accolades for the work. I had obviously heard of academic biases towards ‘big names’ but it still disappointed me to experience something similar firsthand, at least to some extent. On the other hand, it makes sense that people would observe certain unchanging patterns in behavior regardless of their background, experience, and education. Human psychology is the same everywhere, I suppose. Following the logic, an argument in favor of such biases is that it just optimizes for low false-positives: Hinton, Bengio, or LeCun are more experienced and therefore better positioned, given their track-record, to produce the next game-changing construct for deep learning than a random Tom, Dick, or Harry, no? The discussion could go on, even though ethics and morals dictate everyone should receive a fair chance irrespective of prior biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What’s your point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher education has become a ‘status’ more than value-adding mechanism; it has become a societal norm more than an educative move to secure a better life. If your kid gets through engineering and you don’t have significant financial constraints (sometimes, even if you do!), they are almost &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; to pursue some form of higher education. The Masters degree at most institutions is structured as a professional degree and is designed to produce employable engineers, sure. But the sheer number of programs that are being made available indicates either the duplication of the same content under a different banner, or a serious loss in quality of programs. A lot of institutes simply do not have the resources to completely equip their students to succeed but since they realize that Indian students (I can’t speak to other nationalities) are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money on a ‘US education’ even in sub-par programs, they advertise themselves as the ideal fit. They go to ridiculous lengths to procure admissions - I received international calls solely based on my GRE Score (I did reasonably well on the test) to discuss my application to their school! Before even finding out about the rest of my profile, you want to offer fee waivers and ‘fast-tracked’ admission to your institute?! Sounds logical. The sad thing is, this works for them more than it should. A lot of parents get carried away and a lot of kids actually do the carrying away. Everyone is fascinated by the idea of living abroad, distance from the hearsay that is part and parcel of Indian society, independence from familial oversight, and a whole lot of pictures for boosting that social media profile that’s been lying dormant for a while. Not many realize it is not as easy to post cheerful selfies on Instagram whilst being fully aware that you won’t make the next loan payment unless you get a summer internship. Neither is it sustainable to party every weekend if you expect to make the deadlines for most of your assignments without plagiarising content and getting yourself kicked out of school. But I digress. My point, as it stands, is that education should not be about the brand but about the value it adds to our lives. Everyone should have the right to get a great education at a reasonable cost, but everyone should not feel the &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to pursue such opportunities as the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; means to a stable life. That leads to poor decision-making because of the wrong motivations, often resulting in unpaid student loans, low-paying jobs, dissatisfaction, and psychological side effects including stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But you speak from a position of privilege. How can you claim to understand what those kids face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you’re right. I can’t. But those kids are my friends and I know of the hell that they have been through. It is not a great place, and I can cite examples to back my claims. Unfortunately, when we made our decisions, we didn’t have others to guide us along the way. But these kids are trying their level best to talk to their peers and juniors in an effort to prevent them from making the same mistakes all over again. All I am doing is putting my world-view out here for someone to read. There is no immediate need for them to align theirs with it. I find different perspectives help view the same problem with better resolution so that is all I hope to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all my posts, I would like to state that my view(s) might be a bit too sharp, naive, hopelessly misguided, uninformed, or plain wrong - &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; I believe it is worthwhile to write about these experiences given &lt;strong&gt;not only&lt;/strong&gt; that -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MLHEP is a nascent and actively growing field with outsiders constantly attempting to enter without much domain knowledge; &lt;strong&gt;but also&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At some point this might prove helpful to a confused student struggling to understand what working as an engineer in high-energy physics has in store for him/her. Heck, most of the time, that confused and struggling student is me but let’s just say it’s ‘for a friend’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as I explain in my &lt;a href=&quot;/the-blog&quot;&gt;motivation to blog&lt;/a&gt;, I am mainly writing so that future me can read it and laugh at what an idiot I used to be. I am &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; open to being corrected based on data that was unknown to me (or overlooked) at the time of writing of the articles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swapneel Mehta</name></author><category term="research" /><summary type="html">I am a Computer Engineer working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) on machine learning for high-energy physics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the last post in a 2-part series. While the &lt;a href=&quot;/2018-07-10-a-students-guide-to-living-abroad-I&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; highlights the preparatory phase, this post focuses on how life is different from what I expected when I first went abroad; it highlights the ups and downs based on a set of anecdotes and experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-disclaimer&quot;&gt;The Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My primary motivation to write this article is to present a balanced view of both sides of the coin when it comes to living abroad. However, you will note that at certain points there is a certain amount of cynicism with which I look upon the conventional notions that (I believe) a significant proportion of my peer group (and myself at one point) subscribed to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I write this article after having spoken at length (over the past year and a half) with a number of my friends that come from Indian universities and were accepted into the ‘top’ programs across the United States. I add to this my own experiences living and traveling in Europe. While this covers a significant portion of the target audience, I would agree with the claim that my dataset is limited and thus my arguments might be too specific; difficult to generalize at times. I will try my level best to keep the discussion general but over and above that, I trust the reader to make rational assumptions when extrapolating my arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This last disclaimer is mostly for when my parents call me up concerned about my mental health; I’d like to clarify that I’m quite happy and satisfied with where I am and I absolutely love the work I’m doing. However, this is mainly a result of the right combination of opportunities and luck. I fully recognize that this is not a combination that works out for everyone (or one that will continue to work out for myself in the future), and that is why I present this argument with a generous dose of cynicism at times, as opposed to painting a rosy picture of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prelude-and-a-regulatory-warning&quot;&gt;The Prelude and a Regulatory Warning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Freedom!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought when I stood facing the immigration counter at Mumbai airport, en route the next phase of my life in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many Indians going abroad, I considered this my chance to be “independent” &lt;em&gt;(often synonymous with ‘wild and free’)&lt;/em&gt;. 
Freedom from the oversight of my parents; 
Freedom to spend &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; money where I want; 
Freedom to travel the world; 
essentially, freedom from the bucketload of socioeconomic constraints affiliated with the average ‘stay-at-home’ Indian student’s existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my head, I was planning all sorts of activities - I had travel plans lined up to Madrid, London, and South Africa. They were mainly machine learning summer schools; a combination of work and studies. Maybe that was why I didn’t give a second thought to the life that I was leaving behind and the people waving goodbye from the other side of the window at T2, Mumbai International Airport. Maybe I was so excited for what lay in store that I didn’t feel sad for what lay behind me as I headed into a jostling crowd of ‘foreign’-bound Indian aunties and uncles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone tells you leaving home is a life-changing experience; most stories conveniently omit the ‘hard’ bits of their experiences. Suddenly, you’re thrust into a world of possibilities. It could mean that you travel the city, meet new people, share new experiences, and try out new cuisines. This worldview meets with a counterview called ‘reality’ pretty soon. All these ‘new experiences’ sound pretty awesome until you realize that they could also mean you’re stranded on the tram stop at 1 am with no mobile network, as you squeeze your way out of the crowded bar of puking partygoers after a meal of tasteless, parboiled vegetables that constitutes a ‘traditional’ supper. Life is funny that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I believe it is a great idea to be excited about new phases in life - temporary or permanent; good or bad. But on the other hand, it is unnecessary to have the wrong expectations of people and places you’ve never been to. A lot of my friends ended up getting an inaccurate idea of the responsibilities associated with moving abroad and they were more often than not in for a rude shock rather than a pleasant surprise. They seem to have coped well, but then not everyone is that lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an era where ‘living my best life’ porn has hijacked the purpose of social media, I think it grows increasingly important to provide a reality check to counter this gold-plated fantasy people assume everyone else lives. Calibrating the right expectations &lt;em&gt;at least for the peer groups I am a part of&lt;/em&gt; is what I hope to achieve in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is as much a reflection of the experiences of my friends in the United States as it is an observation of life in Europe. Its suitability for extrapolation to life in other countries would depend on regiospecific patterns and nuances, but I hope some of the ideas I highlight can calibrate expectations on the right scale. For my part, I definitely believe I have had (and continue to have) a well-balanced life at CERN, but I concede there have been lows to match the highs. I will utilise these as anecdotes to highlight some common misconceptions that I had and how they impacted my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, my opinion might be too cynical for many (including myself) to take seriously, but I hope the readers can make that distinction for themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In retrospect, I emphasised the setting for this article twice (once in the disclaimer) but I feel in the current light of a blind mass-migration of Indian engineering graduates abroad this is a really critical point to drill in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I left my home, my people, and my country behind in search of opportunities to launch a career as a computer engineer; full of an effervescent joy for the life that awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just another kid trying to make a living for himself and his family. I genuinely believe I am lucky to be on a path to make useful contributions in my line of work - artificial intelligence. Early on, I had a lot of vague ideas about ‘changing the world’ that eventually gave way to narrower, quantifiable, concrete goals within a ‘grand plan’. In fact, I have this ‘Book of Ideas’ that highlight some mind-numbingly awesome plans I came up with as a kid along with a commentary on the pros, cons, and obstacles for each. Funnily enough, some of these plans have already been “copied” by startups that are doing really well for themselves. But I take solace in the fact that this serves as validation - some of these crazy ideas actually had substance to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to my goals, I’d get a bit technical here if I were to highlight specifically what I’d like to achieve when I say ‘change the world’ but I’ll save that for a more detailed post later on. For now, let’s just say that there are always tweaks and improvisations to this ‘grand plan’, but I am happy that I am somewhere in the vicinity of realizing it in the next decade or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reality-check&quot;&gt;Reality Check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think excitement comes naturally when we consider living abroad - exploring new cities, cultures; working or studying at elite universities and leading an Instagrammable existence. I was no different. It was a fantastic country to live in, wonderful friends that I already had, brilliant researchers on my team, and extremely supportive parents. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of my friends heading to the United States were similarly quite pumped about learning from top-notch faculty, engaging with a wonderful set of classmates, building a global network of professionals, and receiving opportunities to work at firms at the bleeding edge of the tech revolution that AI is leading. I think it was a fair set of ideals to bear in mind, but most of us were not prepared for the point at which the tsunami of reality hit us. Lectures were hard; assignments took a significant amount of time and effort eating into the major part of the day; classmates and roommates were not the most helpful, often creating issues when living together; and the job market was dismal given the sheer number of applicants for the same post, factors including the political climate, arbitrary hiring practices, and the role of plain old luck in acing a standard programming interview. It takes a bit of time to realize this world is not as glamorous as it is made out to be. It is rewarding, but only after months of hardwork, weeks of sleepless nights, and almost daily battles with annoying roommates. To be perfectly clear, these are a cumulative set of issues over a short period that affected the bunch of friends and people don’t have to deal with all of these at once (unless they get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; unlucky). But these issues do crop up from time to time and it takes a nontrivial amount of effort to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finances&quot;&gt;Finances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independence comes with its own set of freedoms and the freedom to manage your own finances is one of these. A lot of people heading into grad school underestimate the mental impact of having to pay back a loan has on a candidate that is going through the grind of assignments and exams on a daily basis. If you are like me, you are constantly reminded of the exchange rate whilst purchasing groceries at the local supermarket. They have all these sayings that really don’t make sense to you until you are thrust into situations where they apply. Managing finances reminded me of how responsiblities and freedoms were two sides of the same coin, and how real shit could get if I had been the sole breadwinner for my family. Sure, I was relatively lucky because I was generating a comfortable income, but had I been in a situation where I had no income but only expenditure I daresay I would be under considerable mental strain as well.  I cannot possibly fathom the amount of stress that one would have to deal with if one’s family depends on their future income - that’s real &lt;strong&gt;adulting&lt;/strong&gt; right there. It impacts work; it impacts studies; there is nothing you can do about it except hold on to the idea that you will eventually get a job and pay everything back. That will make all the sacrifices and risks worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;loneliness&quot;&gt;Loneliness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Solitude is a great place to visit until you realize nobody might be waiting for you back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone likes the idea of having ‘me-time’ and the best part about living on your own is the ability to determing where to spend your time outside of the classroom/workplace. But on occasion, it also feels nice to have people around. This hits hard (at least initially) - particularly for those of us moving from a very active familial environment to a studio apartment living in a room with housemates who might not be around much. You move from constantly having somehting to do into an environment where you might actually have nothing to do for hours on end (unless you’re like me :P) - or at least nothing you’d rather do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loneliness hurts, and most of us are afraid to talk about it; afraid of seeming weak and desperate. In my opinion, it’s a factor for a lot of mental problems that people claim to suffer from. I’ve been there for a short while and it isn’t a great place. Luckily, I have friends who never let me feel lonely for really long (annoyingly lovable pricks), forcing me to speak with them, do something I enjoy (sketching, cooking, running) or simply go out and meet new people. Find yourself a friend circle that will help you stay strong, engaging with you when you need them while giving you some personal space otherwise. At the same time, reciprocate the favor and do make time if you feel your friend(s) need(s) you. Most people just need for you to be there on the other end of the line and they’ll handle the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;damage-control&quot;&gt;Damage Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I’ve been a bit too serious throughout the post so I’ll share some lighter views before heading into the next part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life is worth living, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all my claims of having developed a melancholic worldview, I think moving out of your home is a critical experience for moulding a wholesome personality. As we grow up, most of us mature into young adults (I didn’t). This maturing doesn’t come about on its own - it is a product of experiences (and bad ones matter more than good ones), learnings, principles, and practice. Living and studying abroad is a really fast-track way of achieving a ton of experiences in a limited time span. It teaches you lessons in a way nobody ever could have imparted the same ideas. I genuinely believe it’s worth a shot, for the right reasons, and in the right situations. Everyone isn’t immediately going to be able to move out of their houses, but if you ever get the opportunity, do try it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts about living in a new city is that traveling anywhere even within the city is basically a vacation with very little travel time. Plus, you can make trips to friends in nearby cities which makes for a very active set of weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, at least during the semester, this isn’t going to work well mainly because the fatigue is often not worth the weekend of fun. Sure, if you can manage to make the time and you find it worth it then by all means go ahead. All I mean to say is that it varies with people and situations. On the whole, though, Spring Break and Winter Break make for wonderful week-long trips that result in a significant amount of Instagrammable content (for the future influencers reading this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adult-supervision&quot;&gt;Adult Supervision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No more adult supervision because you’re the adults now. Oh… crap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody is around to shout at you for coming home at 2:30 am anymore. No more lectures on how you’re missing out on umpteen health benefits because you don’t eat eggplant curry. Nobody around to check that you’re studying and not bingewatching Game of Thrones on the night before your exam (I &lt;em&gt;aced&lt;/em&gt; that exam, okay!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Indians with the typical familial restrictions on dressing, partying, drinking, or dating, this is a gold-mine of opportunities. I’ve had quiet, docile friends turn into alcoholic partygoers. That’s an exaggeration, to be fair, but my point is that this opens up the doors to a lifestyle most would never have access to if they continued to live around imposing families. You can now go out when you want, party as much as you’d like to, stop drinking milk (I’m surprised how much that comes up) and eating stuff you don’t like, watch movies late into the night, call your significant other over, maintain an active dating life, or whatever the heck you want. There is nothing to stop you save for the fear of consequences arising from poorly reasoned life choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my parents aren’t controlling in any sense (and neither were most of my friends’ parents), but I do know of the occasional case where the kids lashed out at years of unhealthy restrictions by taking every opportunity they got to engage in activities that were not accessible to them before. It usually didn’t end well but those are a result of their decisions alone. So it’s a fine line between freedom and anarchy that is entirely dictated by the amount of responsibility one would decide to exhibit when ‘let loose’, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-joy-of-living&quot;&gt;The Joy of Living&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Life is an uphill ride. Pedal hard, because you’re sitting on a bike with no brakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is going to be hard, but the fruits of your labor will be just as sweet. It is really cool to survive all these experiences. When you look back at the arduous path you took navigating a series of situations in the best manner you could, it feels really satisfying that you ended up where you did. For a change, mom cannot take as much direct credit (although she will try) for your success albeit their presence did make a critical difference everytime. You can actually feel happy about &lt;strong&gt;adulting&lt;/strong&gt; like a real adult, something that tells you you’re probably ready to grow slightly older and more mature than you were before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I doubt I have grown any more mature than I was two years ago, but I have &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; learnt a ton of vital lessons about living, loving, and losing. Obviously, as a professional I have developed far more than I would have imagined, courtesy a wonderful team and encouraging community. That would probably be another post at a later stage - highlighting how 2018 has been one heck of a rollercoaster ride. But I would say I genuinely enjoyed this journey and look forward to the next chapter starting later this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generalizing-the-arguments&quot;&gt;Generalizing the Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have frequently used the term ‘abroad’ where I really mean to imply ‘away from home’. I realize now that the same arguments apply in situations where one moves to a new city albeit within the same country. For India, where cultural diversity varies drastically from region to region, moving to a new city may as well be equivalent to moving abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have utilised examples for both working and studying abroad and it should be noted that there are subtle differences between the two where I have painted the picture in broad strokes than would highlight these nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-in-switzerland&quot;&gt;Life in Switzerland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switzerland, for the most part, is just plain wonderful. In comparison to many other countries, we have little crime, little poverty (if you’re poor and homeless, you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; can’t afford to live in Geneva), lots of mountains, valleys, rivers, and a big-ass lake. I spent a week traveling around with my family and can confirm it is, for the most part, composed of a charming and picturesque set of villages and towns with a dash of modernism added here and there. Swiss chocolates and cheese are renowned the world over and finally I can claim to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a village on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border called Saint-Genis Pouilly (‘saun-genie-poo-ey’) and bike down to the Swiss side where I work (yes, border crossing is chill out here). It’s cheaper, less travel, and closer to the beautiful Jura mountain range than the options I had available in Geneva. However, there are understandably fewer social events, gatherings, and parties in Saint-Genis if you’re new to the area as opposed to Geneva that actually possesses some semblance of nightlife. It isn’t as important initially, but this lack of socializing opportunities might get to some people later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working week is about 40 hours, with some ups and downs based on your personal preferences. My team is pretty relaxed about how I manage those hours although I am usually at my office for about 8-10 hours a day. I also have side-projects and personal commitments that I work towards in the additional time I have. Evenings are usually meant to cook dinner, chill with my housemates (we recently realized we share a love for chess!), or simply watch a few episodes of Fresh Prince of Bel Air (I just started BoJack Horseman, though). Finally, on the weekends there are usually outings planned, parties to attend, places to be, or a few movies to watch. Incidentally, this weekend I’m spending on wrapping up some incomplete blog posts. I get enough time to spend on myself and I signed up for Taekwondo lessons at CERN about three months ago. Turns out CERN has everything from a finance club to a sailing club for its members to subscribe to. That makes it really convenient and affordable to find activities for your spare time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-pros&quot;&gt;The Pros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of pros to living in Switzerland: firstly, the standard of living is pretty high. You will be enjoying top-notch services wherever you go; discomfort is rare and usually addressed quickly. Next, the weather is pretty mild throughout the year. To be clear, there are rainstorms and snowstorms but the frequency of these and (judging by Mumbai standards) is really not much. The temparature reaches slightly under freezing on a bad winter day but it isn’t too bad to step out of the house, almost ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mountains to hike up and valleys to ski down. Water sports open around the summer and adventure activities are aplenty. Geneva also has a lot of festivities around the few months of summer although it reduces around the winters. I had a lot of fun learning ice-skating this winter (two lessons and I can skate without falling), courtesy a friend who proved an encouraging mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and most importantly, the crime rate is almost zero (if not zero). Like, there is literally no danger if you walk through the city unaccompanied at even 3 am in the night (I know because my friends and I have done this :P). Sure, there are some areas where it might be unadvisable to do this but for the most part, it is perfectly safe to hang out anywhere at any time. This has its advantages because living and traveling is much easier when you don’t have to worry about the safety of yourself and your belongings. Small things like if you have to visit the ATM at an odd hour, you don’t have to think twice about your safety which is not what I heard about many other cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cons&quot;&gt;The Cons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a price to pay for everything and boy does Geneva take that adage seriously. It costs between 10 and 25 Swiss Francs ($12 - $28) to have a fairly decent meal and travel costs about $16 if I’m going to and from the city (passes make it cheaper in the longer run). I’m not the partying type but I have been to parties and I can confirm that booze is not cheap either, so if you like having a good time, be prepared to shell out for it. The price isn’t as much of an issue because most people here are also paid well to live in Switzerland (well, we aren’t paid as richly at the student level but it’s still a comfortable wage). But it takes a while to adapt to the cost of living (I know it did for some of my friends and myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue I faced coming in as an Indian student working in the summers versus working in a year-long contract was that the summers were all fun and frolic which didn’t serve as enough preparation for what comes later. The nature of the work environment at CERN is that most of us are temporary hires (‘temporary’ ranging from a few months to a few years). You barely get used to a certain set of friends and suddenly, people are leaving and you have a completely new peer-group to hang out with. In my case, it took a huge mental effort to convince myself to go out, attend parties, network and expand my friend circle. I’m not so much an introvert as plain lazy to engage in these activities but my housemates were really active in this sense, and the atmosphere even at home was quite lively most of the time. On occasion, they dragged me off to parties that ensured I maintained a healthy social life. I was fortunate enough to keep bumping into crazy friends (man, did we have good times!) but this always came with the regret that the time we had to hang out was finite. It was the only issue I ever had with life out here, but I also understand that they hire us in fixed-contract roles for a reason and it’s really not that bad to get to know new people from time to time. On the bright side, this ensures I have friends in most major cities around the world. That is pretty useful when you’re couch-surfing on vacation ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have attempted to provide a complete picture of life abroad as an Indian student. Sure, I write this in my limited experience and capacity but it’s a start and I hope to be able to expand on this as I move to the next stage of my career starting grad school in a new country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully understand there might be biases that creep in and experiences that others might not share. I have tried to keep it rather broad bearing in mind the audience for this post and I hope you found parts of it relevant to your respective situation(s)!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swapneel Mehta</name></author><category term="life" /><summary type="html">This part is about the grind.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Traveling without Wanderlust</title><link href="/on-traveling-without-wanderlust" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Traveling without Wanderlust" /><published>2019-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-02-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/on-traveling-without-wanderlust</id><content type="html" xml:base="/on-traveling-without-wanderlust">&lt;p&gt;The definition of travel varies with what you want to get out of it. I write this post to highlight my perspective and learnings from a summer of traveling across a few countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t traveled a lot by conventional standards - I do not (cannot) claim to represent the broad generality of travel in my views. But I did take a whirlwind tour of summer schools and conferences across London, Madrid, and South Africa across a month that gave me reasonable insight into the world of travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-think-of-travel&quot;&gt;What I Think of Travel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Craziness is what my mother called it; adventure is my preferred description for traveling the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view of travel has its nuances based on my expectations of what an ideal trip is, and as I said before, these expectations are bound to vary with people of different ages, cultures, professions, and backgrounds. Sure, having fun is top priority but I like to make travel about more than just ‘fun’. For me, it’s a process of distilling interesting parts of diverse cultures and peoples and using it to inform my perspective. I find that following this principle helps me have a far more lasting impression of a place than my Instagram handle does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t have anything against Instagram (or for that matter Facebook or Snapchat) - in fact I do have the occasional post to my own handle. It’s just that I felt (at least in my social circles) people are overdoing it and not in a good way. Sharing happiness and momentous occasions are fine but we (especially the younger generations) start drawing a sense of fulfilment and validation from making our lives seem picture-perfect. In the longer run, this could have far-reaching psychological consequences which scares me away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, I have scoured the murky depths of price-comparison websites for last-minute deals, booked flights on seedy airlines, missed connections, been denied a Visa until hours before the flight, been dropped off to my hotel by kind strangers, and been mugged (without loss of any valuables; sucks for the robbers). I’ve learnt a few lessons about travel that I hope to share in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson-1-break-the-ice&quot;&gt;Lesson 1: Break the Ice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone has a story to tell but most people don’t bother trying because they lack good listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like stories. I always have. From Disney’s Golden Book Collection of the classics to Roald Dahl and Ruskin Bond, I am fascinated by the occasional novella. This quirk morphed into my proclivity for people’s life stories, and travel, I quickly found, was a wonderful opportunity to do this. All I had to do was ask nicely and listen carefully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversations began quite formally but took surprisingly interesting turns. Following one of my flights, I found myself being dropped off to my Airbnb in Madrid by a kindly aviation official who said I reminded her of her son. We’re now friends on Facebook and LinkedIn. On another, I chatted with a recruiter from an investment bank about opportunities to work with them. On a third, I found a Ph.D. student working on pretty cool Linguistics stuff and was offered advice on pursuing one. In retrospect, most of this happened simply because I broke the ice as opposed to putting on my headphones and switching on a movie in the flight. It also worked out because they didn’t do the same right upon taking their seats. &lt;em&gt;But most importantly, it worked out because I tried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson-2-bring-yourself-joy&quot;&gt;Lesson 2: Bring Yourself Joy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t run through the fields so fast that you can’t stop and smell the flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re biking in the mountains, travel is meant to be relaxing (some would argue biking is more relaxing which I find fairly reasonable). Find what makes you happy and keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like taking pictures, go the fuck ahead and take them. If you like eating a burger and fries at a French Restaurant, ignore the waiter’s judgemental looks and order that damn cheeseburger! Stop worrying about what people say or think about you. I know it isn’t as easily done, but when you’re happy you will be surprised at how easy it is to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to experience firsthand how summer schools work: from the structure and actual delivery of the lectures to things like organising outings, I think it is incredibly cool that machine learning schools are popping up across the globe offering us a firsthand experience of lectures from a diverse set of academics. So I clubbed travel with summer schools because I realized that satisfied my definition of ‘traveling with a purpose’ and brought me joy. In my understanding of travel, I preferred attending lectures by day with the evenings reserved for hanging out with participants hailing from all across the world discussing quirks in our cultures and traditions. I also received critical feedback on my poster about our work at CERN and a &lt;strong&gt;ton&lt;/strong&gt; of advice on going about a Ph.D. that was quite useful as I set about applying to grad school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored the cities, heading off in search of cafes and pubs that were known for their local fare. I didn’t mind missing out on the most popular tourist spots as long as I could learn about a bit of the historical significance, find some cool cuisines, or simply enjoy the city and its architecture. It brought me joy and I didn’t care what people thought of it &lt;em&gt;(I got comments along the lines of being a workaholic which I might agree with, but I had way more fun than I would care to admit so the tradeoff was quite worth it).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson-3-adapt-and-improvise&quot;&gt;Lesson 3: Adapt and Improvise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Things do not always go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans do go awry more often than you would imagine. Traveling is like trying to eat a piece of pie precariously balanced on the edge of a knife - it looks delicious but before you know it, it might tip over and splatter across your trousers (I have absolutely no idea why I used that analogy but belated Happy Pi Day, everybody!). For instance, being a vegetarian, you are almost certain to have to compromise on available food options, and trying to travel cheap almost always ends in discomfort. On one occasion at Oxford, I was stranded about three miles out from my hostel in the middle of the night while it rained and the streetlamps blew out all because I wanted to see a pretty sunset and lost my way to the river. Another time in Madrid, we missed the bus meant to transport us to Segovia and instead took a train and raced it down to the destination (turns out it was so much fun that it ended up being the best experience we had in all of the two weeks we spent in Madrid). I have been hiking while we ran out of water; freezing cold on top of a mountain in the rain; bathed with freezing cold water in the chilly winters for over a week. I never complained frankly because I didn’t see the point - it would have solved nothing anyway. The only solution was to adapt and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a small subset of reasons that force you to adjust in terms of comfort and familiarity or force you to think on your feet and come up with viable solutions to address the situation. Improvisation can be the best and worst parts of travel depending on what you choose to make of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lesson-4-stay-vigilant&quot;&gt;Lesson 4: Stay Vigilant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Don’t die. That’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part where a lot of us take things for granted and end up in bad situations. I am careless, I will admit that. I do not keep track of my belongings and on occasion, I end up paying a heavy price for it. For instance, I ended up overpacking my bags on a few occasions and whilst removing some belongings at the very last gate right before boarding, I dropped my wallet at London Heathrow, realizing this right after the flight took off. I was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; lucky to get it back with cash and cards intact, but things could have gone very wrong had I kept my Swiss Card in that wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not shed more light on this via anecdotes but suffice it to say I have seen my fair share of unsafe experiences mainly on account of my own stupidity. Don’t be like me. Be smarter. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, we come to the end of this brief article and my learnings from a summer of travel. I do hope to travel a bit more over the next few years so I expect to update this with more lessons and interesting anecdotes soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swapneel Mehta</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">The definition of travel varies with what you want to get out of it.

It will include a year in review, learnings from working at CERN, and some technical posts about the kind of work I do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a recent graduate of Computer Engineering working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). I got into a “US top-15” school for pursuing a Masters in Computer Science starting 2018 but chose to work as a Technical Student for a year instead. My goal in spending this year at CERN is to to gain more perspective and better understand my interests before diving straight into graduate school. As I worked on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DL4Jets/DeepJetCore&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; at the CMS Experiment, I really developed a strong liking for problems we face in high-energy physics. This series of posts will serve as a reflection of the people I have met and experiences I have shared over the past summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-to-summer-schools&quot;&gt;Applying to Summer Schools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year started on a mixed note;  I was excited about working at CERN, but also wondering what directions to take in order to prepare for graduate studies. My aim is to learn by doing and make the most of opportunities that come along. So I decided to figure out how to improve my knowledge of machine learning that was essentially self-taught—taking online courses and working on a project aiding the deployment Tensorflow models in production on the CMS Software Environment. I spent two weeks researching and applying to machine learning summer schools with my supervisor (and former supervisor) supporting me with reference letters wherever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schools had some really cool speakers lined up which I thought would make for a great introduction to subjects like gaussian processes, natural language processing, causal inference, probabilistic methods, bayesian non-parametrics, and optimisation. The application process for the schools was fairly straightforward (often doing away with the reference letter) and encouraged students to present posters of their ongoing/completed projects. I ended up visiting two schools - Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School (Oxford, UK) and Machine Learning Summer School (Madrid, Spain), apart from the Deep Learning Indaba (Stellenbosch, SA). My poster on our work (DeepJet) was presented at MLSS and the Indaba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I learnt later how presenting posters forms a critical part of the experience; it fosters discussions on a plethora of interconnected domains promoting quick and reliable knowledge transfer. As Jeff Dean said in a talk at the Deep Learning Indaba, “If I had a choice between reading one research paper in great depth or just skimming through ten papers, I would choose the latter because that gives me a broader idea of the problem space that I can then build upon.” Poster presentations accomplish pretty much the same goal and in addition foster collaboration and interest in relevant work by others you may not otherwise hear of.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I also learnt later how lucky I was to have qualified for these events that are otherwise primarily targeted at an audience of Ph.D. students (except for the Deep Learning Indaba). This gave me an invaluable set of opportunities to connect with researchers and graduate students who were perfectly equipped to offer &lt;strong&gt;relevant&lt;/strong&gt; advice to me (a lot of people can offer advice, but very little is often relevant).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;takeaways&quot;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a brief outline of each of these events along with what I learnt from each of them. In this post, I’ve focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/687473&quot;&gt;Fourth Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mlhep-2018&quot;&gt;MLHEP 2018:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Machine Learning in High-energy Physics Summer School was organised by researchers from Yandex, Skoltech, and HSE at Oxford University in the UK. It is an event targeted at Ph.D. students and Professors in Physics seeking a foothold in machine learning to find applications to their respective problem statements. However, given that I was working on a project along similar lines, it served as a pretty good primer for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;school-highlights&quot;&gt;School Highlights&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The school began with two tracks—one slightly more advanced introduction and another for beginners to programming and data science.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lectures adhered to a (really useful) hands-on format where each talk was followed by a practical coding session teaching the practical uses of each model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018&quot;&gt;MLHEP Starter code&lt;/a&gt; was really well documented and overall quite thorough in its treatment of the subject. It should serve as a useful reference even for those who have not attended the event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was a set of invited lectures (one per day) that was truly the highlight of each day. It made me wonder how they shortlisted speakers but whatever the process was, it clearly worked. From an introduction to Quantum Physics and Deep Learning to NVidia’s use of AI, to Advertisements on Oracle Data Cloud, and a detailed architectural breakdown of Google’s newly introduced Tensor Processing Unit - these lectures did not disappoint! The slides for each of these lectures has been kindly &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018&quot;&gt;made available&lt;/a&gt; by the organisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Codalab Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amidst a packed (read 7:30 am - 7 pm) schedule that prevented me from visiting this popular vegan joint (sadly, it shut by 5 pm daily) we had yet another activity - a multi-phase &lt;a href=&quot;https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19818&quot;&gt;Codalab Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on the Semantic Segmentation of LArTPC (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber&quot;&gt;Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber&lt;/a&gt;) tracks! Phase 1 was now open to us and the rest would follow soon after.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t understand much about the title, don’t be disappointed. I didn’t know much about it either. But I did know that we had free GPU Credit and some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018-starterkit&quot;&gt;starter code&lt;/a&gt;, and when someone is so kind as to give you a free GPU and some machine learning models, it is only natural for your overfitting instincts to kick into overdrive. So overfitting aside, that’s exactly what I did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My first four attempts gave me exactly zero accuracy. I had no idea what I was doing wrong. After 14 hours of training (I woke up intermittently through the night to check up on the model) I realized I was not preprocessing the data correctly. Long story short, after a series of modifications to my code, I arrived upon a seriously crappy model and placed almost last on the leaderboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That was probably my breaking point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now there were two undergrads at the school who didn’t really participate in the challenge (to my knowledge, and based on the leaderboard). The rest of the thirty-ish people were Physics Ph.D. Students. They understood exactly what a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber&quot;&gt;LArTPC&lt;/a&gt; was, in addition to having the same starter code and a reasonably good understanding of machine learning. Then there was me - the third undergrad with almost entirely self-taught knowledge of machine learning (I’ll write another post sometime about my opinion on the Indian Education System) and barely any understanding of the properties of the track data. Did I really expect myself to miraculously arrive at the optimal hyperparameters for this problem given that I was already drained after 12 hours of attending the school daily?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then, I binged on a box of Pringles and reevaluated matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was an undergrad among 2nd and 3rd year Ph.D. students (also some Professors) and I still managed to not only get in but also successfully understand most of the topics taught in the school.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The very fact that I had a submission placed me in the top-30% of the school (many people decided against participating due to various issues including the time constraints and a limited understanding of the starter code).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did finally start understanding what LArTPC was about, after watching some introductory lectures. It wasn’t that complicated. And the history of the TPC was pretty cool (I like reading about the story behind things).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used the more complicated model - the Message-passing Neural Network instead of the Convolutional Neural Network simply because I wanted to ‘try something new.’ I managed my model fairly well by tweaking the learning rate, playing around with dropout to prevent overfitting, switching around optimizers, and adjusting the number of training epochs. The accuracy (to my recollection) was 80-something percent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given that it was my first Kaggle-like challenge, this was a pretty great outcome. Giving up now would be a very silly idea. Either way, there was only a day more left. Instead, why not try to push harder for a day without any expectation and see what I get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For the next three nights, I didn’t waste a lot of time on dinner, grabbing what I could from the nearest restaurant. I focused on reading up about the physics end of things and understood what exactly the challenge expected us to do. Then, I dug up some esoteric stuff on graph nets that led me to the conclusion that this was not going to be easy to pick up in a few hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Earlier I had assumed the code would be easy to tweak since I was looking at it from an outsider’s perspective. On diving deeper, I realized that it was “messier” (arguably “over-modularized”) than I had thought. Custom functions were called that were defined in separate files and directories and overall it took me a bit of time to try and get it working. To be fair, this was really nice code, but in the time we had it was difficult to digest everything. So I figured out how to use the base architecture, hacked together a working model, and set it training while I read up on how message passing works.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next few days were basically low on sleep and high on Tensorboard and excitement. I find that I get really excited about the little things especially when I like what I’m doing. Although I didn’t expect to achieve much, what I was doing seemed really interesting so I spent time understanding (or rather hypothesizing) why some models gave me better accuracy and losses but didn’t really produce an output as good as others on the test set (overfitting, maybe?). A very naive way of looking at it is that there’s tradeoffs between the learning rate you use and the number of training epochs that you need to monitor as the losses go down and accuracy increases. The plot has slight bumps (in the wrong direciton) after a point that seem to tell you that you might be overfitting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I realized it wouldn’t be feasible to use all of the training data (I/O was waaaaay too slow) nor would it be easy to create batches currently given the time constraints and custom code (I just had a day left at that point and we still had lectures). These tradeoffs resulted in a lot of updates to my approach and the code, ultimately arriving at a set of models that seemed to do okay, placing somewhere near the upper half of the leaderboard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As the deadline loomed and I submitted my last model, I landed up 4th on the Phase 1 Leaderboard for the challenge with an accuracy of 90-something percent. This wasn’t the miracle win I expected (blame Hollywood for setting my expectations high) but it was undoubtedly a decent result for a first-timer given the aforementioned constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next morning, the CodaLab Challenge winners were asked to present their models. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yandexdataschool/mlhep2018/blob/master/day6-Sun/AlexHeld-20180812_MLHEP2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, who stood first on the leaderboard, came up to explain his entry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As I listened to Alex talk about how he visualized the data (used the CNN for visualizing the features? not clear on this) and tweaked the learning rate and a lot of jargon (but in the nice sense), I was very impressed with the work. Having nothing else to focus on as they announced the next winner, I started planning my journey back to Heathrow from Oxford - I didn’t want to miss my flight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A friend sitting next to me elbows me as he points to the leaderboard. “Isn’t that you?” 
“What?”
“&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smehta&lt;/code&gt;, that’s your username right?”
“Oh, right. Well, shit.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mother of God, I stood second. How? Well, you see the challenge had multiple phases, and they simply used the test data from the second phase (only slightly advanced from Phase 1) to evaluate the models. This resulted in some models not performing as well - surprisingly enough, mine did. They had told us this before, and I remember I had tweaked my training and preprocessing to accommodate for a better score overall, but I was so busy with training afterwards that I forgot they would consider the results of Phase 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can the user &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smehta&lt;/code&gt; please come up and explain their approach?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I knew I wasn’t going to follow up Alex’s presentation with something really technical so I decided to do the easy thing - tell them exactly how I did it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve never used a Message-passing Neural Network and I wanted to see how it works so that was my main motivation in participating in this challenge. My first few tries failed which was when I updated my preprocessing pipeline. The core principle I used to tweak my training parameters was basically what Andrew Ng said in Coursera Machine Learning, Week 4 - ‘If you are approaching a minima you need to adjust your number of training steps and learning rate such that you neither overshoot it nor converge too slow.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, ladies and gentlemen, is what I call machine learning (sarcasm? maybe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for more posts about experiences from the two other events that I had the privilege to attend this year - Machine Learning Summer School (Madrid), and the Deep Learning Indaba (South Africa).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swapneel Mehta</name></author><category term="summer-school" /><summary type="html">This post is the first in a series of posts highlighting my attempt(s) to prepare myself to undertake research and for graduate school.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This comes first because people often tend to ignore this very relevant section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; no single way to achieve a successful outcome for your application to graduate school and this post comprises mainly of opinions that I hold based on no evidence other than a product of my personal experience with the process (which is limited, to say the least). All I’m trying to do by writing about this is to give you some perspective to enable you to think for yourself before you embark on the arduous process of applying to grad school. Goodluck!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, please refrain from plagiarising the content. You know how badly a few lifted (and/or uncited) lines could mess up your application (and academic career), right?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at this set of personal statements, instead, as the quality of essays that your competition writes (these are for a mix of Ph.D. and Masters programs) and use it as positive reinforcement to ‘up your game,’ so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While applying to grad school, please don’t make amateur-ish mistakes for your essays. It’s a really cliched piece of advice when people say “you should tell them a story.” Don’t get me wrong, you can. But you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read this if you haven’t done so already: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2015/10/how-to-write-a-bad-statement-for-a-computer-science-phd-admissions-application.html&quot;&gt;How to Write a Bad Statement for a Computer Science Ph.D. Admissions Application, Andy Pavlo (CMU)&lt;/a&gt; (it is Ph.D. specific, but you can extrapolate to Masters applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, admissions are very variable and top schools almost always look favourably upon relevant national and international awards, and publications at top-tier venues especially when they filter applicants for competitive programs like CS (AI/ML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaving stories, as stated before, may make or break your case depending on who reviews it. Ultimately I believe it’s a math.random() process because there is a human on the other end, and human intelligence - unlike many manifestations of artificial intelligence - is highly unpredictable. I wanted to share some links for reading before you guys start writing (since we’re only a month out from the earliest deadlines in November, hopefully you’ve already started writing a draft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Statements from professors/research scientists/Ph.D. Students often yield insight into not only their goals, but also areas of active research in general which is why I’m including some samples for candidates to read in order to ‘get a better idea of their field’ before writing their Statement of Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;my-personal-favourite---anant-bhardwaj-beng-pune-univ-ms-stanford-phd-mit&quot;&gt;My personal favourite - Anant Bhardwaj (B.Eng. Pune Univ., M.S. Stanford, Ph.D. M.I.T.):&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mainly because this was the first (and only) Statement of Purpose I read before applying for a Masters in Computer Science right after undergrad (although I later decided not to jump into it, but work at CERN for a year instead).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you read this set of statements, I’d like to explain my reasons for highlighting this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It clearly depicts how an SoP evolves from a story woven around nascent experience working in tech and aimed at a short-term goal into a research statement that focuses on a specific field and hopes to achieve a long-term goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an Indian B.Eng. student at Mumbai University, I could really identify with this as it was written by a fellow B.Eng. graduate from Pune University.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a good example of progress and change of plans coming from a student who went on to do a Masters at Stanford and a Ph.D. at MIT and then dropped out midway to found a company called Instabase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another disclaimer: please do not treat this as a single representative example of how to frame your statement of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-two-cents-on-this-subject&quot;&gt;My Two Cents on this subject:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of these people and a lot of the advice you will see states that they know the exact field they wanted to work on. That is false. Nobody knows exactly what they want to to for the rest of their lives. Very few actually know the general area they want to work on. Most people have only a fair idea and as Ph.D. programs often state on their websites, that is OK. Most of your ideas will change with experience anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you like X a lot but you’ve never tried doing Y, how do you know you don’t like Y and how can you say you won’t like Y more than X once you try it out. That’s understandable. However, you will see that all of these people have one thing in common - clarity. They possess a high degree of clarity in their research focus and know that there are one or two fields that they would definitely like to pursue. All they have done is explain why this is the case. And their innate clarity made the rest of the work they did fit into the theme of their ‘stories.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, what you’re trying to do in your essay is explain one or two directions that you would like to take, back your claim up with evidence (yes, material evidence - including grades, research, and/or projects) of why you would do well in those directions, and finally state what you see yourself doing once you actually get into that direction. Clarity of thoughts is way more important and the only reliable way to get that is to actually be aware of what that direction is; follow active research areas and people working in that direction, and finally, at least have some ideas of what you would do if you were given an opportunity to work there. Write confidently; you don’t necessarily need to highlight why you failed or justify any misses if you can focus on the hits. It’s not necessary that your statement of purpose would have to ‘make up for why you’re not as good as you could have been’ as opposed to ‘focus on how good you can be based on what you have already done.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This post contains a healthy dose of sarcasm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of this article can be represented by this meme.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/cs-meme.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Computer Science Major - Z Shell, Oh-My-Zsh, Terminal&quot; /&gt;
Expectations are aplenty when you study Computer Science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, we are going to bring alive the &lt;em&gt;What I think I do&lt;/em&gt; part. We’re going to pump our terminals full of steroids and make it spout pointless nonsense that — to the non-CS folk— makes us look like we know what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And we will do this in less than 30 minutes, starting now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Didn’t see that coming, did ya?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-terminal&quot;&gt;The Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of most work we do as programmers boils down to a simple aspect of our lives — the terminal. Sure, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that make life easier for the non-geeks among us, but the mark of a true Computer Science Major is that you have spent 4 long years learning how to open and operate the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you wish to open the GUIs, instead of doing it visually by clicking on the icon, open a terminal and type the command that launches the GUI. I guarantee you will feel greater satisfaction about being a CS major than you currently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, until a while ago I realized most of us seriously under-utilise the terminal at the early stages in our career (and also look extremely uncool doing it). We could use a pointer from the people who have spent years working on this stuff just to help noobs (such as myself) feel much better about being geeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So you’re using a Linux distro (or Mac OSX)? That’s awesome. But you’re still using the plain old bash terminal? Probably something that looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/good-old-bash.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Bourne Again Shell or Bash&quot; /&gt;
Good old Bash :’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Or you’ve become a programmer and modified the default profile to something that is actually colorful. Good job. In that case, you’re looking at something of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/homebrew-profiles.png&quot; alt=&quot;Homebrew has Profiles for the Terminal&quot; /&gt;
Homebrew has profiles that you can activate (&lt;a href=&quot;www.jejemaes.net&quot;&gt;Photo Credit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I told you that you can get from these terminals to this next one in a matter of about 29.7 minutes (average case, varies with innate geekiness quotient).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/awesome-terminal.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Awesome Terminal&quot; /&gt;
The “OMFG THAT LOOKS AWESOME” Terminal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you, the Z Shell.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is basically to use a bunch of plugins and themes that help you modify your terminal into a beautiful piece of art that you want to stare at all day long. There’s also the added functionality like auto-completion, command history, but that’s less important (editor’s note: &lt;em&gt;sarcasm&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just look at how pretty it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short explanation is just as you have your default bash shell, you have a version of this that has been customised via plugins and themes that make it much easier to code, navigate, and generally exist in the terminal (as most real programmers do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As history goes, the Z Shell was brought to earth by angels that wanted to enable Artificial Intelligence to take over the world decades before the Rosetta Stone prophesied it would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Show me, Master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. Now that you’ve made it until this part, I’m going to share the codebase that enables you to do this to your terminal. I’ve added customisations for your Vim text editor as well in case you want a change in scene from Sublime Text 3 (the decision to switch comes with the added bonus of looking much geekier than ever before). Have at it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s your Stairway to Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SwapneelM/dotfiles&quot;&gt;DotFiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now before you jump to it, I’ve added a considerable amount of theoretical explanations underpinning the files/code that you’re modifying. Do yourself a favor and go through these to avoid destroying your system configurations (just kidding, or am I?).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(editor’s note:&lt;em&gt;he was not kidding&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dotfiles&quot;&gt;Dotfiles&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What exactly are dotfiles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configuration files on unix, or ‘dotfiles’, often begin with a dot. For example, .vimrc stores your vim settings, .bashrc stores your bash settings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In UNIX file systems, dotfiles are text-based configurations files that stores settings of almost every application, service and tool running on your system. These files control the behavior of applications from boot to termination and everything in between. People create backups and elaborate setups of their dotfiles and often share them on GitHub or other code hosting platforms. Helping them setup, their systems faster and restore their configurations when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bashrc--bash_profile--zshrc--vimrc&quot;&gt;.bashrc / .bash_profile / .zshrc / .vimrc&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These files are basically used to define environment variables and append paths that you would require for installed applications. When you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, you are just refreshing the definitions of the variables in the file. The same goes for your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file, it contains specific configurations for settings and plugins that are used when you open your text editor with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; command. Each time you modify it, you probably need to shut and reopen the vim editor to refresh those settings. There are also ways to do it from within vim (without shutting it) such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:so %&lt;/code&gt;.

  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You copy the same &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; file and rename it to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init.vim&lt;/code&gt; for your Neovim to use (it must lie within &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.config/nvim&lt;/code&gt;). But you get that it is the same idea - define custom settings in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rc&lt;/code&gt; file and then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; it whenever necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do we need them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine I destroy your laptop in a way that the data can’t ever be recovered. (Pretty dark, right?) and ask you to restore all your little shortcuts, tweaks, and settings that you took hours to configure in your applications. An impossible task. Not really. This is actually where dotfiles come in, these nifty text files that you save, contain thousands of key-value pairs defining each and every aspect of your applications. You can restore your system back to that point in a matter of minutes. (answer by Vipul Gupta)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sh&quot;&gt;sh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sh (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (ksh88, dash, …). bash can also be considered an implementation of sh. Because sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation (such as bash) on most POSIX systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bash started as an sh-compatible implementation (although it predates the POSIX standard by a few years), but as time passed it has acquired many extensions. Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself bash is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language. bash supports a –posix switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as sh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. Many of the useful features of bash, ksh, and tcsh were incorporated into zsh; many original features were added. The introductory document details some of the unique features of zsh. It assumes basic knowledge of the standard UNIX shells; the intent is to show a reader already familiar with one of the other major shells what makes zsh more useful or more powerful. This document is not at all comprehensive; read the manual entry for a description of the shell that is complete, concise and up-to-date, although somewhat overwhelming and devoid of examples.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-root-users&quot;&gt;Non-root users&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually, when you log into your personal computer, you have ‘administrator privileges’ or ‘root privileges’ i.e. you can run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; command. This gives you a lot of control over the installation but also holds you responsible should anything go wrong. Technically, you could actually wipe the entire system clean (delete &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; everything). Please don’t try this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, this root privilege means you can create and install files in the system directories, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. That also means that when you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;, your software also gains privileges to copy and create files in the corresponding system directories. That’s why it doesn’t require much manual copy-pasting labor to get it installed and running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, often whilst configuring this stuff on a new system, you do not have root privileges (and never will, in the near future). In this case, you need to understand some concepts in order to debug the installation should you run into issues (which you shouldn’t, but we all know you will).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run a command, the system searches for it on the path. What is this path I speak of? Well, the system stores all its ‘commands’ which are basically files that are run in the shell in a folder called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/bin&lt;/code&gt;, which, on different systems, is symlinked (symbolically linked, or ‘points to’) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/sbin&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever else. The point is, all your code to be executed when you type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; is stored in such directories that are then put on the system path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system path is essentially a variable that contains a list of ALL the locations/directories to search for a command. You can add, remove, or delete all the paths (please note the original content of the variable before you clear it). Try using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo $PATH&lt;/code&gt; to see how this works on Unix. You should see a list of directories that contain the code to be run following each command you type.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance when you type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python xyz.py&lt;/code&gt;, the system first looks in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever directory is first in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable and finds a link to where the python installation is. Then it executes all your code in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xyz.py&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. This directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; is common for all users of the system. So the same code runs for all of them when they type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you get why you cannot allow anyone to modify the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; folder. It’s simply because the next time &lt;strong&gt;User X&lt;/strong&gt; types &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, you don’t want this modified code by &lt;strong&gt;User Y&lt;/strong&gt; to start downloading the latest episode of Sacred Games (or maybe you do) or worse, a computer virus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, as a non-root user, when you try to install things, there are some directories where you cannot write files to. On top of it, some restrictions also mean you cannot &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yum install&lt;/code&gt; packages. In such a case, you can usually just download the packages from Github (or elsewhere) and manually install them. The instructions vary by package.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea, however, is that you can always install in a random directory (in this case, we prefer the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$HOME&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; directory) and then add the file to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable. This tells the system that it has to also look in (for instance) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/neofetch-5.0.0/&lt;/code&gt; to find the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;neofetch&lt;/code&gt; command (in case you have not installed it using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same goes for neovim, where I have first added the path to neovim installation to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable and then added a line called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;alias vi='nvim'&lt;/code&gt; which means the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt; command which I conventionally used to open the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; editor is now replaced by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nvim&lt;/code&gt; command which is searched for on the path and found in the neovim directory:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # added by NeoVim
  export PATH=&quot;$HOME/neovim/bin:$PATH&quot;

  # Remove this line if you do not have neovim installed
  alias vi='nvim'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

While this one is focused on making preparations for the travel, the next one will (hopefully) provide deeper insight into how life works and what to expect from the outside world based on my experience so far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I told my mom that I’d be traveling to live in a new country: in this case, France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You will die of starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She seemed supportive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks were spent teaching me to avoid dying of starvation and it would seem mom made it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been through the process, I’ve got some tips and tricks to share for students going about this the first time around. I’ve tried to use broad strokes and avoid region-specific concerns but you can feel free to email me about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is meant to serve as a guideline for traveling like a beast — obtaining maximal efficiency with minimal luggage; learning the ropes of survival on 35kg of baggage allowance. It incorporates elements of preparedness for moving to a new house, living alone in a new city, with new people around. I’ll try to use examples of my own practices although, fair warning, I’m no expert and still need to sit on my bags to shut them. But at least I don’t have to haggle with the check-in crew for extra kilos anymore (I lied, I still do).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Indian boy, especially a Gujarati (we’re known for our affinity with food), traveling abroad I honestly had one single concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How much of my kitchen can I possibly stuff into my luggage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, it’s a trade-off between carrying that prized cardigan or a pack of freeze-dried paranthas (Indian flat-breads). In my case, I had about 35 kilos of luggage allowance, but evidently even two bags of 23kg are not enough for some whilst migrating to a new land. A lot of my rather affluent friends purchase additional luggage to transport a sizeable chunk of India along with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is basically me trying to tell you (and parents possibly concerned about your survival), “Chill out. You’ll live.”
(Not) Planning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I traveled to Switzerland for a couple of months, I didn’t bother to plan. That’s a really bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I carried along a lot of stuff that I could actually have bought for cheaper in France/Switzerland compared to India. This included a truckload of clothes, some food items, and spices that I never ended up using. Let’s take a look at these items:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready-to-drink Tea Mix: Unless you’re traveling extensively, you’re not going to need more than 5–7 single sachets of this mix. Usually, I prefer the normal way of boiling tea leaves with milk and that’s been replaced slowly by the fantastic coffee I get out here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freeze-dried Food: My mother, after substantial research, painstakingly cooked 7 kilos of two different vegetable curries (Pav Bhaji and Mixed Veg.) and had them dehydrated into packs of food that I could then simply boil and eat. To be fair, it was a pretty useful item until I realized that I could actually cook. Then it became a really mundane meal and I kinda liked the fresh, hot, spicy (even shitty) food that I made, so quite a few packs were left unused by the end of my stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chilly Flakes and Oregano: These two Italian spices are used globally, so carrying huge packets, in my opinion, was not a great use of my limited luggage space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biscuits: Don’t waste your time and space trying to stuff five packs of Bourbon down your bag when we all know the first thing you’re going to do is buy Oreo in wholesale quantities once you land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rice and Flour: A friend of mine wanted to carry along kilos of rice and flour. People eat both these items the world over, so please calm down and search for the nearest grocer. I can guarantee with absolute certainty you will be able to find affordably priced products nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thermal Wear: Google the weather before traveling, and for heaven’s sake don’t go overboard with your woolens. If it’s a cold place, it’s very likely the stores nearby will stock cheap winter wear. Some of them have really great deals in the summer so buying in advance might save you dem moneys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socks: Amazon is everywhere. Amazon delivers the heavens to your doorstep. I carried along like twelve pairs of socks but I could just as well have bought them in France (or via Amazon France). Sure, they may be a little more expensive, but you could use the extra space to carry along spices that you might need more than the socks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toiletries: Travel packs are fine, but there’s really little use in carrying along bigger bottles of shaving gel, shampoos, soaps, etc. especially if it’s not medically necessitated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes: Carrying your wardrobe along is a painstaking process, not to mention an expensive one in terms of baggage allowance. If you’re going someplace in the summer just take a look at the local shops, sales, and order online. In my case, the $100 I would spend on carrying an extra bag of clothes could be used to buy the same number/quality of clothes from local shops (H&amp;amp;M, Celio, etc.) in the summer sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know how that works, let’s move onto the actual planning that would help optimize your packing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packing is all about prioritizing what you need. Some things are vital, others just aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: Food is ubiquitous. People eat food everywhere. Don’t look so surprised, it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I had no clue what kind of food I’d rely on in Switzerland, so I did what anyone with half a brain (and little use for it) would do: I brought my kitchen with me. Every single spice I could lay my hands on, I stuffed into the bag. However, when I actually spent 15 minutes searching for alternatives once I arrived in Switzerland, I was able to find a decent set of brick-and-mortar Indian stores in pretty much every major city from San Francisco to Delft, and Boston to Geneva. Apart from that there’s online options available in the USA as well as Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did eventually end up ordering online via a store called Swiss Rasoi that gave us a decent discount since we found 4 other Indians and ordered products in larger quantities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: They have a sale each month, email them about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course the trade-off for buying this stuff abroad is that you pay a lot more than you would in India. But if you’re moving abroad for a longer duration, you’re going to have to bite the bullet at some point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;planning-tips&quot;&gt;Planning Tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy City:&lt;/strong&gt; The internet is at your fingertips. Don’t just search for places, search for people already there. Ask for suggestions unabashedly. Figure out the hacks that can help you live an easier life; I don’t just mean free refills of soda at the local fast food joints.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Weather:&lt;/strong&gt; Having knowledge of the kind of weather you are going into is very helpful because it can help you plan the kind of clothing you require. If you’re traveling in the summer, you can purchase winter clothes on sale, saving yourself copious amounts of both, cash and luggage allowance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Locality:&lt;/strong&gt; Even within cities, it is often a diverse landscape and some neighborhoods may be better than others (also more expensive). If you’re traveling, try to use Google Street View to check out the locality, the local stores, and most importantly whether Amazon delivers to the ZIP code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Public Transport System:&lt;/strong&gt; A systematic public transport system is extremely crucial in saving your time and can help you figure out the feasibility of traveling to local stores. Most of the times, you will find that Google Maps offers a fairly accurate picture of the schedules and means of transport but this is not always the case. Try to figure out the apps that help track local bus, tram and train schedules and check your connectivity to assess how likely it is that you can shop for groceries daily/weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Roommates:&lt;/strong&gt; I got lucky to find the best roommates ever. We cooked, cleaned, worked, and traveled together. Connecting with your roomies beforehand enables you to split essentials, manage your packing e.g. not everyone needs to carry that mini-pressure cooker or the same old bunch of spices. Besides, it helps to know you’re not living with serial killers. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know thy Telecom Providers:&lt;/strong&gt; International packs from India cost me between INR 2,500 and INR 4,000 and gives me maybe a hundred minutes of calling to India, a couple of gigs of internet and so on. A Freemobile (yes, it’s a company) costs me 25 Euro (~INR 1,600) and gives me 50–100GB of pan-Europe internet, and unlimited calling to international* numbers (including India). It’s always simpler if you know the plans in the country you’re moving to because eventually you’re going to be getting them anyway.
*maximum of 200 different phone numbers, but it’s still a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-visa-application&quot;&gt;The Visa Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I required a Schengen Visa for my work in Europe, but before that I was planning on attending school in the USA so I had an active F1-Visa that I later returned following the return of my I-20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Schengen Visa permits travel within 26 countries situated in EU and Switzerland (Switzerland is not officially a part of the EU but for practical purposes, you don’t need to worry about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This also means the Swiss use the Swiss Franc (CHF) and not the Euro. Some places accept both, but offer bad exchange rates for Euro to CHF conversion so you’re better off carrying CHF in advance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-swiss-schengen-visa&quot;&gt;The Swiss (Schengen) Visa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Visa Application in India, VFS is a courier company that collects your application and biometric details and sends it off to the Swiss Embassy in New Delhi. Some tips for the application for the Swiss Visa:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be clear about your Visa-type. For students, it’s usually the &amp;lt;90-day Visa or for longer stays (e.g. 1 year), the Type D National Visa (at least at CERN).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the Visa-type there are checklists available for the supporting documents required. Go through these thoroughly before doing anything else. Read a few different checklists if you’re like me and want to get a better idea of what you might need (even though you really won’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preferably book an appointment 6+ weeks before your travel dates. It barely takes a few days for your Visa to arrive but having a buffer period is safer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases, you need to get a bank statement verified by an official that shows you have some funds to sustain your lifestyle. For most banks this takes a few days so get it done early on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get your bookings in order; especially residence. You can use Booking.com or Hotels.com for at least a temporary accommodation solution until you finalize the details of your stay. I booked my return-trip flights in advance but I’ve been told it’s not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a very “stringent” procedure because it’s not “an interview” — as per my understanding, VFS acts as an intermediary, and is supposed to help you out with preparing your application for the Schengen Visa. So no need to be nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Visa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my F1 Visa Application, I have a vague recollection of the procedure so I’ll be brief; please confirm these details before proceeding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It had (understandably) a far more detailed application form than the Schengen Visa. They asked me about all the times I had visited the USA in the past and I had to dig up my expired passports to look up the exact dates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They require an I-20 if you’re applying for the F1 or (if I’m not mistaken) J1 Visa. The I-20 must also be presented at the time of arrival in the USA (at immigration).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the fees are to be paid online and cost me somewhere around $160 (INR 10,000) at the time of application.
There are two separate appointments: one for collecting your biometric details and another for the actual “interview.” Yes, this is an actual interview and if you do not answer to their satisfaction, they reserve the right to refuse your Visa without justification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As per what I have seen and heard, your finances matter here. I can’t offer any “magic combination” to pass all scrutiny but simply be clear about what you are saying and avoid falsifying information at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a hunch that your institute matters because I was going only for a summer but I was given a 5-year F1 Visa. My I-20 was from a highly reputed institute so maybe that made life much easier for me. Or maybe I just got lucky (although I ended up returning the I-20 and Visa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;flight-selection&quot;&gt;Flight Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booking flights isn’t always about getting the cheapest travel option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it mostly is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student, it is easy to just go for the cheapest options but if you’re looking to go a little deeper think about it this way: if you travel smart, the more you travel, the cheaper it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So a slightly more expensive flight option now will get you not only more comfort and luggage allowance now but also help you improve your traveler status and increase the probability of free upgrades in the future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will avoid going into details but you can read more about airline alliances that comprise of 3 major groups of airlines that allow you to earn miles when you fly any of them in the same group. Later you can redeem them for vouchers, discounts, and of course free flights. Alliances also have tie-ups with some credit card companies and car rental services to help you earn free miles so take a closer look and maybe you’ll find yourself traveling business class on a free upgrade before the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is to request student status, a provision most carriers offer. At the very least you get extra luggage allowance, but sometimes you might get good discounts. Student tickets are often non-refundable so ensure that you’ve got a solid plan in place before finalizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: If you travel like I do (overfilled luggage; prepared to haggle at check-in counters), it helps to transfer most of your weight to the ‘laptop bags’ or ‘purses.’ They have never bothered to ask me about the big-ass laptop bag I carried with me (I travel Emirates, in case you’re wondering).
Update: Based on a friend’s experience, Etihad did charge them for extra kilos at Abu Dhabi. Avoid pushing your luck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;layovers&quot;&gt;Layovers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be very excited about flights (note the past tense). The first time I booked my trip from India, I picked a Lufthansa flight to Geneva with a 9-hour layover in Munich because why the heck not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a plan, and a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-plan&quot;&gt;The Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will take the Lufthansa shuttle into Munich and then figure out where I can travel around. I never looked into the places I could visit — I would have data or at least free WiFi and I could figure it out.
The Backup Plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munich airport is rated 2nd in the World. It has a mini-golf course and a spa, among other amenities. It costs about 6CHF which is decent. Worst case, I play 9 hours of mini-golf. Not a bad way to spend the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reality&quot;&gt;Reality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data pack was inactive. No network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No problem, I have free WiFi.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WiFi isn’t connecting and there’s nobody around that speaks English to help. In fact, there’s literally nobody around except a few security guys and cleaning staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s alright lets skip the city shuttle and enjoy the mini-golf and spa.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It’s a Saturday morning. The activities are in another terminal and that’s shut for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Fuuu…..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eventually I managed to figure out the location of the shuttle stop at the airport and reach the city center. A kind stranger bought me a train ticket and I roamed around some park; I still don’t remember the name. I ate at an Indian restaurant handled by jovial Pakistani dudes (it’s way more common than you’d think). Turns out the city is pretty lively towards the afternoon and I was served some crappy Lebanese brunch (“Sir, your vegan food”) whilst strolling around the farmer’s market before heading back to the airport. Pretty great layover overall, but things could have gone very wrong that day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planning-done-right&quot;&gt;Planning Done Right&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I traveled to Geneva, I was a seasoned veteran of air-travel (mostly just in my head though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still ended up over-packing, rearranged my baggage at check-in, haggled with the personnel, and successfully managed to carry the other half of India into Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, I was more aware of what I should carry along and the items that had most helped the past summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cash: It isn’t really necessary in the USA since most stores accept card payment, but in some places around France we still are required to pay in cash so it becomes necessary to carry sufficient cash or find an ATM assuming you have low fees for international withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Universal Travel Adapters: Mostly due to my Macbook (USB-C ftw), but also travel adapters are mighty useful to have in general. They can get pretty expensive to buy on airports or souvenir shops so be sure to carry a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essential Spices (bare minimum):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Chaipatti (Dried, Crushed Tea Leaves);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Red Chilly Powder;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dhanajiru (Cumin + Coriander Powder);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turmeric;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Jeera (Cumin);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rai (Mustard Seeds);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hing (Asafoetida);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Chaat Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Garam Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip: you get sugar, pepper, and salt literally everywhere, including the airplane!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advanced Cooking (bare minimum):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Poha (Rice Flakes);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Biryani Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pav Bhaji Masala;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Aamchur (Dry Mango Powder);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gud (Jaggery);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Imli (Tamarind);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tejpatta (Bayleaf);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Elaichi (Cardamom);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Laung (Cloves);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dalchini (Cinnamon);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kali Mirch (Black Pepper).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Namkeen: You don’t always have time to shop so keep some ready-to-eat food handy just in case you need it:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Maggi, always;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Haldiram’s Poha.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready-made Food Mix: Basically these are powders that you can use for various purposes without much effort:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MTR Dosa Mix;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MTR Upma Mix;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talod Dhokla Mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vacuum-sealed Stuff: The first time I went, mother made some rotis, theplas, and paranthas (different Indian breads) at home and had them vacuum-sealed at the local grocer. It lasted around 2 months since I put it in the freezer immediately once I reached France. It’s a temporary hack, but it works. She also made me a minced chilly mix that I didn’t use as much but was helpful when we ran out of green chillies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooking Appliances: The Pressure Cooker is infinitely useful. It is indispensable unless you have enough time to spend in the kitchen boiling rice and potatoes in a pan (this doesn’t take as long as you’d imagine). Get a small one along, it is worth the effort. I tried to carry a Roti Maker this time but unfortunately when I tried it out, the voltage shorted it. Sucks. But I can make roti without a roti-maker (that’s a lie, I’m too lazy). Okay fine, I will try again and update this post. Next, there’s the Pav Bhaji masher — I’m unaware of its exact name but hopefully you get what I mean. Finally, carry a good thermos along for the daily beverage or simply hot water, if you can spare the luggage space for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old Passports: If you intend on traveling to multiple countries, some places ask about your travel history for the Visa Application. It isn’t mandatory, but it helps if you have your older (even expired) passports to carry along.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving License: One big plus is that if you can drive in India, you can drive pretty much anywhere (in theory). Your license is valid between 6 months to 1 year, but it is advisable to get an international license made because it’s much cheaper in India. It’s amazing how empty the roads are, but ensure you know the road rules. Parking spots are a pain to find and more importantly understand. Fines are hefty. Also, don’t drink and drive. You can’t afford it. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Photocopies of Documents: At the office, I can take free printouts. But outside, photocopies aren’t priced at a rupee for a side. Carry attested/sealed copies of at least your mark-sheets, passport, and Visa in case it is required on short-notice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Passport-sized Photographs: Carry about thirty. I’m not kidding; Schengen requires a different format from the standard passport-sized photographs. Get the standard as well as Schengen-format photos printed so that you save time and effort spent on getting them made abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Munchies are awesome. Food here is bland, and most of my junk food comprises chips. “Mobile” Khakhra (Roasted flatbread) is a welcome break when I’m too lazy to get snacks at the cafeteria. Mother dearest found me packs of kurmura (puffed rice flakes) I wish I’d carried Soya Sticks but I believe it should be available at the local Asian store. 
&lt;strong&gt;Update: it was not :(&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy Bars: They’re available in a range of varieties at almost all grocerie sand they’re extremely easy to carry around. I have 2 in my bag at all times. Usually I prefer to buy them from abroad instead of carrying them from home. But it works either way. Nature Valley is decently priced if you buy the larger packs off Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parachute Coconut oil (small bottle): Easiest remedy for dry hair after days of daily shampooing. Honestly. Silky Smooth Amazeness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toiletries: While most of these are unnecessary in large quantities, you would do well to carry the tongue cleaner. It’s pretty useful if you don’t find a toothbrush that fits the bill. Seriously. Also nail-cutters; tiny, but very useful once every two weeks (that’s what she said). As a cleanliness freak, I carry a hand sanitizer wherever I go. I just have to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backpack: Invest in a sturdy, light-weight backpack that can be useful on both a regular basis as well as weekend trips. Nobody likes lugging suitcases around. You could figure out decent options once you arrive in case you’re aware of good sales. I know for a fact France has great offers during the summers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronics: If you don’t like spending a lot on electronics, carry a decent set of headphones, extra USB cables, and universal adapters. I like to exercise so bluetooth headphones are a necessity. For backups and other data storage. It could actually be cheaper to purchase hard drives in flash sales (or holiday sales) abroad, but we all know the sources of the ‘data’ that you need are of questionable legality outside the country so you’re going to bring one along anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shoes: If you’re going to indulge in adventure activities please bear in mind that healthcare costs skyrocket pretty easily. If you’re covered by insurance, that’s fine. But since I started play squash, football, and running, I’ve spent a bit of money on good quality running shoes that enable me to run on concrete without the jarring impact to my knees. I’m still dicey on skiing though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack of Cards: Monopoly Deal, Uno, plain old playing cards; try to stuff in whatever you can once you’re done packing the important stuff. Extremely useful when you decide to travel around with your friends and have nothing to do once you’ve uploaded 1500 snap-stories from the car/train/hotel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that covers pretty much all of the basic items you’d require to survive comfortably in a new environment. I’ll update the post with relevant information over time. But for now, good luck preparing for your travels!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swapneel Mehta</name></author><category term="life" /><summary type="html">This is the first of a 2-part series.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The views represented here are solely my own, and do not reflect those of my employer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past summer, I worked as an intern at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is an international research collboration working on high-energy physics and computing, set in a picturesque location cradling the borders of France and Switzerland. I have been receiving a lot of messages about the application process and this post is an attempt to try and address some queries regarding the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had filled out a highly detailed application form last October, wondering if I had a snowball’s chance in hell to get selected into one of the most prestigious international internship programs at a research collaboration that was truly unparalleled in its domain. After a few months of sleepless nights and particle-filled daydreams, I received the much-awaited email from CERN…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was a rejection email from the Summer Student program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a disappointing week for me as I tried to move on and apply for other internships. All of a sudden, there was a ray of light shining through this darkness, in the form of an offer to undertake research at Stanford University. I jumped at the marvelous opportunity and initiated the formalities necessary for the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I finally completed my US Visa Application and acceptance of the Stanford offer, I received yet another email from CERN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still remember that was the day I was discussing something with my mother who was cooking. I was leaning against the door then, and we were casually chatting when the notification popped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/openlab-selection-email.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Openlab Summer Student Program Selection Email&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had read in novels about someone that ‘fell flat down’ on receiving some news. For the first time it actually happened to me. I literally just dropped down to the floor in a cross-legged position and told mom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ma, I got into CERN”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Huh, what are you saying? And get up, who asked you to sit there!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Ma… I got into CERN!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“What is that?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“CERN, Ma! The internship that I applied to in Switzerland?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“If you keep going around like a fool applying to all these places how do you expect me to remember!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My mother, ladies and gentlement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the story, I spoke with my potential advisor at CERN and the Professors at Stanford discussing at length about what would be a better idea for me. Despite not knowing me beyond our email threads, the professors were extremely generous with their time and supportive of my decision to accept the offer from CERN. My Openlab supervisor even offered to accommodate dates of the program such that I could do both! It was then that I knew that I had struck gold in terms of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, CERN &lt;em&gt;was paying&lt;/em&gt; me while Stanford required me to (more or less) support myself. More importantly, the professors were open to discussing potential opportunities in the future. That made my decision slightly easier to make. Anyway, fast-forward to a month later, and there I was sitting on the Y Bus traveling from Geneva Airport to my hotel in Saint-Genis Pouilly, France (yep, work in Switzerland, live in France - the CERN life ;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/geneva.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The Openlab Program is hosted at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The City of Geneva&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internship at CERN has been an amazing learning experience not just in terms of the work but also in terms of people — each with a unique story to tell. These factors have contributed in no small part to the life-changing experience this has been. I arrived as a wide-eyed teenager, and left as a wider-eyed teenager, with an insatiable curiosity to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CERN drives you to push a little harder, seek a deeper understanding, and try to find a better solution to the problems you work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work was understanding, modeling, and ultimately solving a problem — also about addressing the complexities that arose when we attempted to expand the solution to a broader set of applications. With an organisation of this scale, there are going to be multiple problems of a similar nature, with fine lines of separation. As my supervisor told me, it’s a personal decision whether you’d want to focus on a microscopic solution that can address a niche problem which may impact macroscopic issues intrinsically, or to attempt to create an an inherently macroscopic solution that could potentially be tweaked to address challenges affecting narrower segments of work in greater depth. CERN afforded me the opportunity to choose my path in spite of being just one of many hundreds of summer students. Amazingly enough, I learnt over the course of the summer, this was a privilege extended to all members of CERN regardless of position or responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit for a fantastic summer belongs, in no small part, with my supervisors, both of whom were the driving forces constantly challenging me to research and review better practices and improve the models for my project — Anomaly Detection in Database Connections. Mr. Prasanth Kothuri and Mr. Daniel Lanza Garcia helped me figure out the research subjects that aligned with my interests and constantly supporting me in terms of resources and domain expertise. If Mr. Kothuri was doubtful about the solution to my issues that were seemingly esoteric, he would encourage me to find others at CERN who possessed the domain-specific knowledge and even accompanied me to some seminars in order to seek the same understanding as I would — and eventually figure out a solution together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was really encouraging to find this kind of support being extended and responsibilities being shared with us in one of the most active and experienced groups at CERN compared to the common treatment as ‘just an intern.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/globe-of-science.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;CERN Openlab: Globe of Science and Innovation&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Globe of Science and Innovation — emblematic of the values CERN embodies (Picture Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jessicawallis.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/18680544482_2cccb5efac_b.jpg&quot;&gt;Jessica Wallis&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project I was working on involved detecting anomalous database connections in order to serve multiple purposes including but not limited to analysing and deriving insights from usage patterns, monitoring the number of connections, and ultimately database security. With no real benchmarks or training data in this field, we set out to find a solution and use various machine learning practices and models to apply unsupervised learning and arrive at a conclusive result. We managed to utilise an ensemble of different models that measured deviation based on differing metrics. Further, we cross-verified results and extracted common anomalies that were then flagged to be verified. Through my interactions with my peers within the same program, I realized a lot of us were working on the same problem with different forms of data. I was motivated to move beyond the scope of my project and build an intuitive system that could not only provide a common base to leverage these models, but also offer an intuitive interface for non-technical users, seeing as a lot of CERN staff include physicists that may not be familiar with cutting-edge computing practices. It was a start towards utilising the research that has gone into multiple Openlab projects into a single end-user application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the personal front, this experience has taught me a lot about people and the way they look at a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had always been reading about how it helps to have different perspectives towards the same problem and I often wondered what it meant. Meeting students literally from the other side of the globe has taught me that there is a lot of truth to this statement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to have probably the best roommates I’ve ever had — notwithstanding the fact that these are the only roommates I’ve ever had. We have cooked, cleaned, driven, trekked, hitchhiked, played, and somersaulted off boats together. Openlab has really provided a unique platform that has resulted in friendships across continents and a network that encompasses most countries across the world. It leads to a sense of security — no matter where we go on after this experience, we will have friends nearby that we can count on in times of need or maybe just to blow off some steam over the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A few Openlab Interns at one of the Experiments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could rave about the past summer until the end of time because it’s hard to out all my experiences into a single blog post but I figure I have to sum it up at some point so I would like to conclude with some quotes from one of the wiser role models in my life, Master Shifu from Kung-Fu Panda, as answers to some of the common questions people have been asking me about getting into CERN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is CERN looking for? What do I write on my application? How did you get into CERN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your real strength comes from being the best you you can be. Who are you? What are you good at? What makes you, you?”
“There is no secret ingredient”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write about yourself, your experiences, your projects, and trust the universe to align the rest of the factors. Maybe you get in, maybe you don’t. All I can say is that you need to ensure you research every detail about CERN before applying because my motivation for applying was derived from the nature of work being undertaken within the specific department that ultimately accepted me. Keep trying until you make it, because honestly, if I did it, you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How was your experience at CERN? Is it really worth it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(in case the blog post wasn’t clear enough)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would do it all over again, twelve times over. Because thirteen is just an unlucky number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the other programs similar? Is it worth undertaking other opportunities at CERN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My perspective is rather biased because like I said, I’ve had an amazing summer. I would always want to go back to CERN (and I did get back as a Technical Student for a year following Openlab). However there are periods where I’ve been told there’s very little activity, when the climate isn’t all that great, and there are hardly any people on the streets of Geneva. It’s not ideal, but your work is undoubtedly going to remain challenging and interesting regardless of how it is outside the window. It’s just that life becomes slightly slow. You must learn to adapt at some point, and this is a great place bustling with activities ranging from Zumba and Krav Maga to lunch hours with random people in order to get to know them better. It’s such a diverse environment that you never going to be bored with so many different nationalities around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the format for your resume? Can you share it with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(added this since there have been so many students asking me about this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a no-brainer, there is no single acceptable format for the resume. All they ask for is a document that carries your experience, achievements, and possibly projects in a succinct, neat format. It is really a pretty simple document to create using the infinite wisdom of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have been selected as a reserve candidate. What are my chances of getting selected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of selection at CERN (Openlab, Technical Student, and Summer Student), as I probably mentioned already (or maybe not) is that they have unique projects each year, for which they require a diverse skillset. There is no single set of skills for which they have an opening each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each supervisor proposes his/her own set of students — there isn’t really a centralized selection committee to filter through the thousands of candidates that apply (although there is one to oversee final selections). So again, nobody can really tell you what your chances are based on past candidates or projects. Please refrain from spamming people with emails regarding this particular aspect because when most of them say they aren’t aware, they really do mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically for the ‘reserved candidates’ I am unaware of the exact process — all I can tell is that it is not an outright rejection but neither does it imply with certainty that your selection is imminent. That is all I know of at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that, I’ve reached the end of the tiny window that I’ve provided into my work and life at CERN. It was an amazing eight weeks and I look forward to seeing more of this place in the near future!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I am back at CERN, working as a Technical Student so I’ll probably be updating this article to eliminate any inaccuracies for posterity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post comprises of a list of lectures that I intend to watch at some point in order to mainly just learn more about these domains. They seem like some interesting areas to explore and some are just plain fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;That said, I have put in a fair bit of research into comparing prerequisites and course information across MIT, Stanford and other colleges whilst compiling this list that should provide a fair overview, to an undergraduate student interested in exploring Machine Learning and Computer Vision, of the courses that relate to the applications of these practices in Genetics and Genomics (yes, they're disparate branches of Biology).&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to look back on the things that I do and writing comes easily to me - it just seems like the logical thing to do. Frankly, I’m surprised it took me so long to actually (finally) build a decent-ish blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a line, it helps get things off my mind in a quick, efficient, indexable manner. Writing often serves as a great tool for introspection, I find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to putting this together after a 5-year journey spanning Wordpress, Blogger, Medium, and plain ol’ &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; drafts of posts that are now likely to see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-motivation-to-blog&quot;&gt;On The Motivation to Blog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate student, I had a lot of questions to ask people about a variety of things related to academia, research, internships, and even good ol’ survival. Getting through engineering with a decent GPA, decent experience, and decent skillset is a surprisingly non-trivial task. I could go on for hours about how it is a poorly designed system (with exceptions, obviously) and - as I later learnt - how it isn’t just India that faces these issues. My friends in Germany, the USA, and a few other places face similar issues as well. I got lucky in finding a set of mentors who were more experienced than me and could guide me well. Experience, here, simply means they made the mistakes I would probably end up making and could thus provide enough perspective to prevent me from making &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; mistake. I still did make other mistakes but thankfully none were fatal to my career (or life, for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I solicited advice from a variety of sources ranging from undergraduates to professors, and from accountants to nuclear physicists. Over time, I learnt how to really use that advice (getting advice and acting on it are entirely disparate skills, as I later realized). The usefulness of a ‘fresh’ perspective is seriously undervalued. I would say this is the real reason diversity is important (especially in tech); on occasion it took barely five seconds before my colleague or advisor asked me a simple question that completely stumped me - why hadn’t I thought of that?! Well, it’s simply because of biases. We are taught (based on culture, demographics, or simply the environment we are used to) to look at things a certain way and eventually, just as the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov demonstrated in his experiment with a dog, we get attuned to looking at them the same way and it is difficult to break out of it. We might not find it as easy to find bugs in our manner of thinking as easily as someone who is attuned to a different nature of thinking is used to. It goes both ways, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get called up by a lot of my peers and juniors to ask for my advice or simply thoughts on a certain set of subjects currently revolving around starting life abroad, doing reasonably well at academics, surviving engineering, undergraduate studies, finding internships, jobs, conducting research, exploring computer science - in particular machine learning - and on a few occasions even cooking. I offer everyone the same disclaimer - I know nothing about most of these things, but I can try to ask you some questions that might help you find your own answers. Most of the time, it is a repetition of the same thoughts and ideas; a regurgitation of the same adages I have been offered by my mentors, and (I would presume) the inheritance of such ideas continues ad infinitum. At some point, writing them down should break the loop and motivate a new set of questions to arise. I believe new questions are necessary and will eventually come about regardless of whether someone writes the answers down. In my case, penning thoughts is a simple means to avoid a repetitive regurgitation of ideals pertaining to education; answering the same old queries about moving to a new country or finding a new job. Most importantly, though, it allows me to reflect and re-look at some pretty fucking stupid opinions I held in the (more recent than I would care to admit) past. I say ‘fucking stupid’ because I realized they were a result of my own biases, but fortunately I have been lucky to surround myself with smarter people who break those down and point me to my flaws painfully often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I have faced a truckload of issues most Indian engineering undergrads battle at some point and while my solutions might not work ‘off-the-shelf’ for everyone, my approach might just help some others out. I’ve been told more than a few people like reading what I write so it’s not a complete waste of my time. That’s more than I could ask for. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still thinking of a better title for this blog but in the meanwhile I think I’m just going to leave it as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-details&quot;&gt;Technical Details&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with the posts written in Markdown. 
I’ve used a theme called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2&quot;&gt;Jasper2&lt;/a&gt; that’s based on the default theme for a publishing platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it out, it’s pretty neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;disclaimer&quot;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of advice to the readers - my opinions are thoughtful, but loosely held (I swear this is not motivated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/principles/&quot;&gt;Farnam Street Principles&lt;/a&gt;); I arrived at that conclusion myself, albeit used their title for it because it made sense. When I furnish my opinions on a subject that is all I offer it as - I do not see it as a permanent and unchanging stance for the simple reason that I do not believe I know everything about anything.
