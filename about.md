## Bio

Swapneel holds a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. He is currently working at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) on using deep learning for problems in high-energy physics including particle track reconstruction and multi-jet classification.
            

## Interests

His interests lie in developing strategies for using the cornerstone of artificial intelligence to advance the natural sciences with a focus on high-energy physics. Broadly, he seeks to work on statistical machine learning to build approaches that can deal with the growing scale, complexity, and variety of datasets in a computationally efficient manner. His work is also motivated by the goal of democratizing machine learning by improving reproducibility and interpretability of existing approaches. A few examples of past projects include a modified open-domain question-answering system, an automated assessment of basic Blender (3D Modeling) Assignments, and a dynamic, automated workflow for an award-winning cybersecurity tool.
            

## Knowledge Transfer: DJ Unicode

Swapneel is passionate about the need for knowledge transfer and to that end, spends time working on a student-run organisation he co-founded with a team of 4 members – [DJ Unicode](https://github.com/djunicode). Unicode was born of the need for skill development at the grassroots level in addition to the need for a rapport between college freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. Their aim was to devote time and effort towards programming and mentoring, eschewing both ‘bureaucratic’ practices, and administrative logjams.

Unicode started 5 teams of 6 sophomores mentored by 4 juniors and a senior, initially restricted within the Computer Department. They worked on 5 projects (3 web, 2 app) all of which are standalone, tested, and available on Github. Today, we are a sustainable and growing community of 80+ members, have teams winning hackathons, internship offers from rising international startups, and 3 selections for Google Summer of Code 2018!
            

## Personal

Swapneel enjoys participating in hackathons and you are likely to find him scrounging for food around midnight at such events.
            
Apart from cooking and biking, Swapneel likes to spend time writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@swapneel_mehta), curating his Pocket reading list, streaming videos from [Agadmator’s Chess Channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AGADMATOR) and occasionally, attempting to share his knowledge on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Swapneel-Mehta).

Swapneel also likes to participate in the occasional marathon, and pretends he is an artist.
