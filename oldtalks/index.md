## Talks

I have given a set of talks on topics including internships, working in quantum physics (from a Computer Scientist's perspective), my work at CERN on deep learning for jet physics, and a project presentation from my work at IIT Bombay and Microsoft Research. 

#### CERN: [The DeepJet Framework](https://github.com/SwapneelM/DeepJetCore)

Package for training and evaluation of deep neural networks for high-energy physics.

1. [Talk at the Machine Learning Working Group Meeting, April 2018](https://indico.cern.ch/event/668017/contributions/2947024/)

2. [Talk at the CMS Machine Learning Workshop, July 2018](slides/deepjet-cms-ml-talk.pdf)

3. Invited talk for the CVIT Lab, Indian Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad:
    - [The DeepJet Framework](slides/cvit-iiit-deepjet.pdf)
    - [Fundamentals of High-energy Physics](slides/light-hearted-look-at-hep.pdf)
    - [Real-life Applications of High-energy Physics](slides/real-life-applications-of-hep.pdf)

*Please note the references for the CVIT (IIIT-H) talk in the last slide of the presentation titled 'The DeepJet Framework.'
