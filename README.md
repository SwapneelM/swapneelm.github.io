* My Personal Blog

*A veritable dumping ground for the thoughts and discussions I would otherwise have had with myself.*

* This site is built from a template created by [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com) and used in a [step-by-step beginners guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) for creating and hosting a personal website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

*(October 2018) Update: I've moved on beyond that basic template but I still feel some credit is due, so I'm just going to leave that on here*
